He is also the lead prosecutor in the high-profile murder trial of former lawyer Alex Murdaugh, who is accused of killing his wife and son in June 2021. But how did Waters become one of the most respected and successful prosecutors in the state? What kind of education and training did he receive to prepare him for his challenging career? In this article, we will explore the educational background and professional achievements of Creighton Waters.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Early Life and Interests</h2><p>Creighton Waters was born in 1972 in Columbia, South Carolina, the son of Samuel Waters, a well-known consumer litigation and bankruptcy lawyer. He grew up in the Heathwood neighborhood, where he attended public schools. According to Primal Information, Waters was different from other kids his age. He was a talented guitarist who loved to read, especially books about history and war. He also had a passion for learning new words and using them in his everyday speech.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>College and Law School</h2><p>Waters enrolled at the University of South Carolina’s prestigious Honors College, where he excelled academically and graduated with a bachelor’s degree in history. He then continued his education at the University of South Carolina School of Law, where he earned his Juris Doctor degree in 1996. According to Celeknow, Waters was a member of the South Carolina Law Review and the Order of the Coif, a national honor society for law students.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Judicial Clerkship and Appellate Division</h2><p>After graduating from law school, Waters began his legal career as a clerk for the late Judge Jasper Cureton of the South Carolina Court of Appeals. He worked for Judge Cureton for two years, from 1996 to 1998, and learned a lot from his mentor. According to Latest in Bollywood, Waters considers Judge Cureton one of his chief mentors and credits him for teaching him how to write clearly and persuasively.</p><p>In 1998, Waters joined the South Carolina Attorney General’s Office as an assistant attorney general in the appellate division. There, he worked under Deputy Attorney General Don Zelenka, another legendary figure in the state’s legal system. Waters handled cases involving death penalty convictions, criminal appeals, and constitutional issues. He argued before the South Carolina Supreme Court, the South Carolina Court of Appeals, and the United States Supreme Court.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>State Grand Jury and Major Cases</h2><p>In 2010, Waters moved to the state grand jury section, where he became the chief attorney and the head of the division.
