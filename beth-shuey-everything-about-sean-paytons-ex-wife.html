She was born in 1968 in Morocco, Indiana, United States. Her date and month of birth are not known, and as such, her zodiac sign is not known. However, it’s common knowledge that she is an American national of Caucasian descent. She was born to Joyce Antcliff and Thomas Milton Shuey, who are now late.</p><p>Beth Shuey has a younger sister known as Debbie Shuey Doyle, who works as a director at LiliNow in Greenwood, Indiana. She grew up alongside her sister under the care of her parents in Morocco, Indiana, and the United States.</p><p>Nothing is known about Beth’s elementary education, but she attended North Newton Junior and Senior High School. She later earned a degree in marketing from Indiana State University.</p><h2><strong>Beth Shuey Became Sean Payton’s Wife in 1992</strong></h2><p>Beth Shuey became Sean Payton’s wife in 1992. The ex-couple met at Indiana University where Sean worked as a coach and he was impressed by her intelligence as well as her interest in his coaching career. He later took her on a date, and many other dates followed. In no distant time, they began dating, but the distance was a challenge as Beth resided in Indiana while Sean resided in a nearby town.</p><p>After dating for some time, they decided to make it a lifetime commitment and got married. Beth supported her ex-husband’s career and was often seen with him in the cities that his coaching jobs took him to. This gave him much success in his career, and he has grown now to become a prolific coach.</p><p>After they welcomed their children, Beth stopped accompanying Sean to work and faced her motherly duties. This time, she also worked effortlessly to build her ex-husband’s foundation, known as Payton’s Play It Foundation. The foundation was set up by the ex-couple to supply educational needs to less privileged families. It also provides health care services to those without health insurance and supports victims of domestic violence.</p><h3><strong>What Happened to Beth Shuey and Sean Payton?</strong></h3><p>Though Beth Shuey and Sean Payton’s twenty years of marriage were successful at some point, they later started experiencing hurdles. However, the couple could not jump these hurdles, as Payton went on to file for divorce from Beth on June 14, 2012.</p><p>Meanwhile, they did not reveal the exact reason for severing their ties, but their divorce filing <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">cited</a> discord or conflict of personalities between them. Sean Payton further stated in his petition that he and his ex-wife will divide their estate outside the court as well as have joint custody of their children.</p><p>However, this did not sit well with Beth Shuey who filed a counter-petition demanding that she be made to decide the custody of her children. She further demanded that Sean pay medical, child support, legal, and education. The divorce was later finalized in 2004, but the outcome was not made public.</p><h2><strong>Did Sean Payton’s Ex-wife Remarry?</strong></h2><p>Yes! Beth Shuey moved on with her love life and remarried. She is currently married to Jamie McGuire, a North Carolina-based real estate broker from Edwell, New York. Neither of the couple has revealed how or when they met, but they dated for a long time before tying the knot. They reportedly began dating around 2010 and eventually got married in 2020.</p><p>Beth’s children graced the occasion and were all smiles as their mother said yes again to her newfound love. Meanwhile, Jamie attended Endwell Senior High School for his high school education and later furthered his education at Wentworth Institute of Technology. The couple lives in Raleigh, North Carolina, and has maintained a loving and peaceful home as their marriage has spanned 3 years without recording any scandals.</p><p>On the other hand, Sean Payton also moved on and found love once more.
