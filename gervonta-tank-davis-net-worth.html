Gervonta "Tank" Davis has held numerous world championship titles, including the IBF super featherweight title and the WBA lightweight and super featherweight titles. In 2022, he was ranked as the tenth-best boxer in the world by the Boxing Writers Association of America. Outside of the ring, Davis has been notorious for his many run-ins with the law, often due to domestic violence charges.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>Gervonta Davis was born on November 7, 1994 in Baltimore, Maryland. As a teenager, he went to Digital Harbor High School for a while before dropping out to pursue his career.</p><h2 id=amateur-career><strong>Amateur Career</strong></h2><p>At the age of five, Davis began training at Upton Boxing Center under Calvin Ford. He went on to have a highly successful career as an amateur boxer, winning three consecutive National Silver Gloves Championships from 2006 to 2008 and later the National Golden Gloves Championship in 2012. Davis also won two National Junior Olympics gold medals and two Ringside World Championships, among other major championship titles. He finished his amateur career with a formidable 206-15 record.</p><h2 id=professional-career><strong>Professional Career</strong></h2><p>Davis made his professional boxing debut in early 2013 in a bout against Desi Williams; he won in the first round via knockout. By the summer of 2014, Davis had amassed an 8-0 record. He continued his undefeated streak throughout the rest of the year and into 2015, becoming the first person to stop Israel Suarez and Alberto Mora. Davis remained undefeated in 2016, defeating Guillermo Avila and Mario Antonio Macias.</p><p>In early 2017, Davis challenged the undefeated José Pedraza for the IBF super featherweight title. He ultimately won the fight via knockout in the seventh round to claim the title. Davis went on to successfully defend the title against Liam Walsh, whom he beat via stoppage. However, before his next defense, he was stripped of his title for declining to weigh in, rendering the IBF title vacant. Davis ended up winning the fight against Francisco Fonseca.</p><p>In March of 2018, Davis went up against Jesús Cuellar for the WBA super featherweight title, which he won after knocking out Cuellar in the third round. Early in 2019, he successfully defended his title against Hugo Ruiz. Davis made a second successful defense that summer against Ricardo Núñez. At the end of 2019, he moved up to the lightweight division and won the WBA lightweight title by defeating <a href=# title="Yuriorkis Gamboa Net Worth">Yuriorkis Gamboa</a>. Davis successfully defended that title on Halloween in 2020 by defeating Léo Santa Cruz via stoppage; he also claimed Santa Cruz's WBA super featherweight title.</p><p>In June of 2021, Davis moved up to the super lightweight division and faced undefeated WBA champion Mario Barrios. Although it was a competitive fight, Davis ended up winning via technical knockout. Later in the year, he moved back down to the lightweight division and fought Isaac Cruz. The bout had Davis going the 12-round distance for the first time in his career; he ultimately won via unanimous decision. Kicking off 2022, Davis made a successful defense of his lightweight title against Rolando Romero, whom he had been scheduled to fight the previous year before Romero was pulled due to sexual abuse allegations. The fight was Davis's only of 2022. Early the next year, he faced undefeated WBA super featherweight champion Héctor Garcia, whom he beat via corner retirement in the eighth round.</p><h2 id=ryan-garcia-fight><strong>Ryan Garcia Fight</strong></h2><p>In April 2023 Gervonta Davis fought <a href=#>Ryan Garcia</a>. Gervonta was guaranteed $5 million and Ryan was guaranteed $2.5 million. Approximately $20 million was earned at the gate from ticket sales. The duo agreed to earn a 50/50 share of the Pay Per View profits, which likely paid each fighter an additional $5-10 million.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-285389 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Gervonta.jpg alt='Gervonta "Tank" Davis' width=594 height=396 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-285389 class=wp-caption-text>Getty</p><h2 id=legal-problems><strong>Legal Problems</strong></h2><p>Since 2017, Davis has had many run-ins with the law. That year, a warrant for his arrest was issued due to accusations of aggravated assault against his childhood friend Anthony Wheeler. Ultimately, the charges were dropped by Wheeler during the trial. A year later, Davis was arrested in Washington, DC for getting into a fistfight with another man. He was arrested again in early 2020 on charges of domestic violence against his former girlfriend.</p><p>In 2021, Davis was indicted on 14 counts for running a red light in Baltimore, resulting in his vehicle striking another car and sending its four occupants to the hospital. He then reportedly left the scene in another car.</p><p>Davis got into more trouble at the end of 2022 when he was arrested and jailed in Florida due to domestic violence charges.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNkv6qvx56qrWWSpMWmvtJonp6qpqS7ta2MrZino12Zrre10malnqxdrLyzwMdo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./glo-data-plan.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Glo Data Plan, Bundles and Subscription Codes 2023">&larr;
