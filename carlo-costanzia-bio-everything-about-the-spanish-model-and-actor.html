His parents were happily married and this made for a good dynamic at home. He also lacked nothing materially. He was well cared for and spoiled. His mom also ensured that he got a good education.</p><p>Things later turned sour for Carlo Costanzia after his parents decided to get a divorce in 1997. He was five years at the time and his parents fought bitterly over custody for a very long time.

At the end of the day, his father was awarded custody and he had no choice but to relocate to Milan, Italy, with him.</p><h2><strong>He is a Budding Reggaeton Singer and Has Several Songs to His Credit</strong></h2><p>Upon relocating to Milan, the young Carlo Costanzia initially found it difficult to cope.

He returned to Madrid and took classes at the Juan Codina Academy. He later made his acting debut in a string of minor productions.</p><p>Carlo Costanzia got his acting breakthrough in the 2019 Spanish-language thriller series, Toy Boy. Toy Boy revolves around Jesús Mosquera, a stripper who is wrongfully imprisoned for murder. Upon getting out, he seeks justice with the support of his friends including Jairo, a gay stripper who is mute/deaf.</p><p>Carlo Costanzia played the role of <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Jairo</a> and his performance was so fantastic that he became a popular personality in Italy and Spain overnight.

His social media accounts are no help in this regard either. He posts randomly on his <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> and <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> accounts and most posts are just pictures of him. This makes it difficult to gauge his love life but he is surely not lacking for love in his life. He maintains a close relationship with his mom and dad. He is also close to his half-brothers, three from his dad and four from his mom, and has stated that he would die for them.</p><p>Costanzia’s mother meanwhile is quite proud of him and has described him as the love of her life.
