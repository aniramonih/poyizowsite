Gary Allan Herzberg has been in the music business since releasing his first album, which was certified Gold&nbsp;Heart Used For Sale.&nbsp;In 2018, the country music legend released ten studio albums and two compilation albums under two different labels.&nbsp;He also had 26 of his singles top the charts on various billboards, including seven in the top 10.</p><h2><strong><span>Gary Allan’s Bio</span></strong></h2><p><span>The musician was born and raised in La Mirada, California on December 5, 1967. His family believed strongly in two things: music and education.&nbsp;Gary joined his father, Harley at age 13 to play regular country music bars called honky tonks.&nbsp;Also, he turned down a recording contract from A&M Records at the age of 15 in favor of completing his education.</span></p><p><span>While at La Serna High School in Whittier, California continued to perform at crowded local venues with her band&nbsp;</span><span>The Honky Tonk Wranglers.&nbsp;</span><span>A mix of opportunity and talent would bring Gary into the spotlight.&nbsp;This series of events began when he met songwriter-producer Byron Hill, who was instrumental in Allan’s career.</span></p><p><span>They met in California in 1993 through a friend named Jim Seal.&nbsp;The two were successful and stayed in touch over the years, often collaborating on small projects.&nbsp;In 1995, Gary Allan received a generous check for $12,000 from a wealthy couple after listening to his demo he had left in the glove compartment of a truck they had purchased.&nbsp;The budding musician used the money to record some of the songs he and Byron had worked on during their first collaboration.</span></p><p><span>Byron sent four of these songs to different labels, which immediately began claiming the rights of the musician.&nbsp;Byron and Gary eventually settled on Decca Records.&nbsp;Under Decca, Allan released his first three albums&nbsp;</span><span>Used Heart For Sale,&nbsp;</span><span>That Would Be You,</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Smoke Rings in the Dark.&nbsp;</span><span>Although the first two albums produced a slew of singles, his third album reflects a musical growth and maturity in Allan’s approach that really gave the album wings.&nbsp;It was certified platinum by the RIAA.</span></p><p><span>After Decca Records folded in early 1999, Garya was moved to its parent company MCA Nashville’s artist roster.&nbsp;In the 2000s, Allan went into overdrive, releasing four studio albums and a compilation album.</span></p><p><span>Alright,</span><span>&nbsp;her fourth studio album released in 2001 produced her first single to top the US&nbsp;</span><span>Billboard</span><span>&nbsp;country charts.&nbsp;Her 2003 album&nbsp;</span><span>See If I Care</span><span>&nbsp;produced two number one singles “Nothing But the Radio” and “Tough Little Boys”.</span></p><p><span>His sixth studio album&nbsp;</span><span>Hard Everywhere</span><span>&nbsp;was a deeply personal album as the singer was facing some very difficult times at this point in his life.&nbsp;The album was a huge hit, shipping 99,000 units in its first week.&nbsp;It also came in at No. 3 on&nbsp;</span><span>Billboard</span><span>&nbsp;200 and the number one spot on Top Country Albums.&nbsp;It was certified gold at the end of the following year.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Gary Allan’s Girlfriend,&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>Wife, Daughter</span></strong></h2><p><span>The California-born country singer has been around the marital block a few times.&nbsp;Gary married his first wife, a woman named Tracy Taylor in 1987 when he was just 19 years old.&nbsp;After getting divorced, he tied the knot with then-model Dannette Day.&nbsp;The wedding took place in South Carolina on November 28, 1998. However, their union did not respect the distance, as they canceled it less than a year later, in June 1999.</span></p><p><span>He married his third wife Angela on June 5, 2001. All seemed to be going well in the singer’s life until tragedy struck.&nbsp;Angela, who had suffered from severe depression and migraines, committed suicide in the early morning of October 25, 2004. Gary had left the bedroom to bring her a coke in the kitchen when he heard the gunshot.&nbsp;She stuck the gun in her mouth and pulled the trigger.&nbsp;Following this tragedy, Gary stepped away from music to grieve in private, but he decided to channel his grief and put it into his music.&nbsp;This resulted in his successful&nbsp;</span><span>Hard Everywhere</span><span>&nbsp;album.</span></p><p><span>Years later, he would appear on&nbsp;</span><span>The Oprah Winfrey Show</span><span>&nbsp;to talk about Angela’s life and suicide.&nbsp;Gary Allan has three daughters from his first marriage: Maggie, Dallas and Tanna.&nbsp;The musician currently has no relationship, however, he reportedly dated model Justina Crosslin between 2007 and 2008.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Other facts to know about Gary Allan</span></strong></h2><p><span>1.
