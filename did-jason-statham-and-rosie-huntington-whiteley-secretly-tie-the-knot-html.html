First, many fans had speculated that because of <a href=#>their 20-year age difference</a>, the couple’s romantic relationship would not be able to last for more than a few months.</p><p id=par-2_24>However, after being in a seemingly happy and committed relationship for the past decade, this gorgeous <a href=#>celebrity</a> couple has definitely proved the doubters wrong.</p><p id=par-3_49>The newest rumor that Huntington-Whiteley and Statham are facing has to do with whether or not they are secretly married. So did the couple have a secret wedding without telling anyone? Here are a few reasons why many fans think that Jason Statham and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley are already married.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jason Statham and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley’s long relationship history</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Jason-Statham-and-Rosie-Huntington-Whitely.jpg><p id=par-4_49>Back in 2010, Statham and Huntington-Whiteley made headlines when they announced that they were involved with each other romantically. At first, they tried to keep their relationship a secret. But it wasn’t long before they were tired of keeping a secret and started being spotted out in public together.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_58>Even though there is a 20-year age difference between the pair, they seemed to have a lot in common and looked to be one of the happiest couples in Hollywood. It didn’t take long for the two to decide to move in together, and soon, their fans were starting to see just how happy they made one another.</p><p id=par-6_48>Throughout the years, the couple never seemed to be too eager to get married. However, in 2016 according to <a href=#>Vogue</a>, Huntington-Whiteley was spotted at the Golden Globe Awards wearing a diamond engagement ring. Then, one year later, Huntington-Whiteley and Statham’s son, whom they named Jack Oscar, was born.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Did Jason Statham and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley secretly get married?</h2><p id=par-7_55>Just a few months after the couple welcomed their son into the world, there were several rumors swirling around that suggested that the pair had secretly gotten married. <a href=#>Vogue</a> was one of the first publications to spot the supermodel wearing what appeared to be a wedding along with her engagement ring in an Instagram post.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_80>So, did the couple really get married? Well, if they did, they certainly didn’t announce it to anyone. And it has been almost three years since they were first suspected of having a secret wedding, so we think that we would have heard something by now. And, although the two do seem to be falling more in love with each other with each passing day, Huntington-Whiteley has always been very vocal about how marriage is not that important to her.</p><p id=par-9_72>In 2015, she told <a href=#>SELF,</a> “For any couple that has been together for a certain amount of time, there is a massive amount of pressure to get married.” She then went on to say that being in a loving relationship with someone is more important than being married to them. She also voiced her desire to one day have children but never said that she felt that same desire to get married.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jason Statham and Rosie Huntington-Whiteley’s relationship is not that unique</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-10_71>Although it may seem a bit odd for Huntington-Whiteley and Statham to be in a relationship for 10 years without ever getting married, as it turns out, it is actually not that uncommon. There are plenty of people who stay in the same relationship for several decades without ever getting married. In fact, there are numerous celebrities who have been in long-term, committed relationships and are perfectly happy not being married.</p><p id=par-11_31>For example, <a href=#>Maya Rudolph</a> and Paul Thomas Anderson have been together for almost two decades and are still “just dating.” The couple shares four kids together and seem happier than ever.</p><p id=par-12_35>Another famous couple that has been together for a long time without getting married is <a href=#>Enrique Iglesias Anna Kournikova</a>. These two started dating in 2001 and welcomed their third child in January of this year.</p><p id=par-13_42>So, it is hard to say if Statham and Huntington-Whiteley are married, or if they will ever plan to get married. As other famous celebrity couples have already proven, you don’t have to have a marriage certificate to have a happy relationship.</p><p id=par-14_13>[Correction: An earlier version erroneously said the couple met while working on Transformers.]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxqrCMo5isp55iwLWt06GYpmWRo7Fuvs6soJ5lmKq7tbXNoKuopl2starAxKWcsmWjmrCzsdOlsGasmZp6tbTEZqKnp6RjtbW5y2g%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./does-mcdonalds-count-as-sales-experience.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Does mcdonalds count as sales experience">&larr;
