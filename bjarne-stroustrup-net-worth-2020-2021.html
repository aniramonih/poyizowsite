If you do not know, we have prepared this article about details of Bjarne Stroustrup’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life & Biography</h2><p>Bjarne Stroustrup was born in Aarhus, Denmark. He had an impoverished and working-class family and was sent to some small local schools, to feed his hunger for education even from that young age.</p><p>During 1969 to 1975, he attended the Aarhus University to complete his graduation with a master’s degree in Mathematics and Computer Science, despite having his actual interests focussed deep inside microprogramming and machine architecture. During his days at Aarhus University, he got to learn the essential fundamentals of Object-Oriented Programming(OOP), from Kristen Nygaard, who frequently used to visit the place, the great man who invented OOP.</p><p>Then later on in 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup even completed his PhD in Computer Science, from the reputed University of Cambridge, England, under the supervision and guidance of David Wheeler. His thesis mainly concerned the various types of communication possible in distributed computer systems.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>Great human beings who spend their entire lives working and inventing things which are going to make the world a better place for the future generations to live in are very rarely found to be in the spotlight or front of cameras, giving interviews. The same is true even for Bjarne Stroustrup, who is not much interested in popularity or fame and loves to keep his private life to himself. Though it’s known that he has been married with the love of his life Marian Stroustrup, and has two kids- namely Annemarie Stroustrup and Nicholas Stroustrup.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 30 December 1950, Bjarne Stroustrup is 73 years old as of today’s date 21st July 2024. His height is 1.65 m tall, and his weight is 65 kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>The greatest any person can dream of achieving from his career is being remembered and admired for all the work he did, and Bjarne Stroustrup is known to the ‘Father of C++’, which should unarguably be considered the zenith of any anyone’s success.</p><p>Back in 1979, Stroustrup began with his career in the Computer Science Research Center of Bell Labs in Murray Hill, as a member of technical staff. It’s over there, where he began with his study and works on C++ and various programming techniques. Having identified his genius and sheer brilliance, Bjarne Stroustrup was made the head of AT&T Bell Labs’ Large Scale Programming Research Department, right from when it was created until late 2002. Bjarne Stroustrup was way more worthy than just being the head, and it also got pretty clear when he was made a fellow of Bell Labs in 1993 and a fellow of AT&T in 1996.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Way back in 2005, Bjarne Stroustrup was the first computer scientist ever to receive The William Procter Prize for Scientific Achievement from a scientific research society- Sigma Xi.</p><p>Then in 2010, he received Aarhus’s University’s oldest and most prestigious honor- Rigmor og Carl Holst-Knudsens Videnskapspris, which is given for contributions made in the field of science by a person who was associated with the University.</p><p>Then in the subsequent years, he was honored with various other awards, like The Faraday Medal in 2017 and The Charles Stark Draper Prize and The Computer Pioneer Award in 2018.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Bjarne Stroustrup in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Bjarne-Stroustrup-Net-Worth.jpg><p>When we are talking about a man, bearing as much greatness and foresight as Bjarne Stroustrup, his credibility can’t just be measured in terms of money. Because of being an extremely dedicated person towards his research works and putting a blind-eye towards media, it’s known that his net worth is $20 million as of July 2024. But sometimes, having considered some great personality like Bjarne Stroustrup, his net worth would be equal to millions of people’s admiration and respect, which he earned through his life’s work.</p><p>People or rather great people like Bjarne Stroustrup come once in a while and paint and change the world as he likes. Today when millions of students across the globe and learning and understanding the concepts of C++, Stroustrup is busy making and inventing something else, which the world needs, but might realize a few years later. That’s the legacy, and that’s the aura which such people leave behind, and leaves the world admiring and mesmerized.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHApauhsaCav7S7zaxlnKedZK%2BrrdGnnGarpKe8tr%2FTq6ypZZ6awW7DzquroWViZX9xeZFpaWpn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./bryan-williams-obituary-2killed-in-crash-on-clay-wade-bailey-bridge.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Bryan Williams Obituary, 2killed in crash on Clay Wade Bailey Bridge">&larr;
