After she catches him spending time with the producer and he is blindsided🤔🤨😮‍💨😑,” wrote a commenter.</p><p>“<a href=#>There was something with this producer </a>from before. 💁🏾 she may be why he lost interest in her. That and all that crying,” reasoned someone else.</p><p>One commenter said, “Austin flat-out lied! He lied! She asked him if he was with a producer, and he said no. Then he backtracked and said they just ran into her. I’m sure he’s been lying all along.”</p><p>Another person added, “The producer should not be ‘hanging out’ with a married cast member. There should be consequences for that.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.monstersandcritics.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/mafs-comments-16.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mafs-season-17-is-not-over-yet>MAFS Season 17 is not over yet</h2><p>The season is winding down to a close, but a few more episodes remain to play out before we officially bid goodbye to the Denver cast.</p><p><a href=#>Along with Becca and Austin</a>, we heard the final decisions of Clare Kerr and Cameron Frazer and Emily Balch and Brennan Shoykhet, who all opted to end their marriage.</p><p>Lauren Good and Orion Martzloff were not a part of the Decision Day episode as their marriage ended early on in the season, and they had already decided to get a divorce.</p><p>We also didn’t see Chloe Brown and Michael Shiakallis since they had a late start in the game. Their Decision Day episode will air at a later date.</p><p>Meanwhile, Episode 21, titled Climbing Down from Decision Day, will air on March 13, followed by Episode 22, Doubts, Dilemmas, and Drag, which will air on March 20.</p><p>Married at First Sight airs Wednesdays at 8/7c on Lifetime.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rrvNrKueqqOWu6Wv0aKropujY7CwuY6trWiqlZa5qsDYZquvZ52Ws7R51aKcsJ2iqHq0uMCmZJqto6m2r3nFqKlmoZ6WvbG%2Bzqmpopmkmnqzscuaq6Knnqi1qryMsKCtoF2otbDDjKmpqJylmLKzew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./mariah-carey-obliterates-competition-in-the-bottle-cap-challenge-with-new-instagram-video-299959.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mariah Carey Obliterates Competition In The Bottle Cap Challenge With New Instagram Video">&larr;
