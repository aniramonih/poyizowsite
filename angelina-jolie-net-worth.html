She has been one of the highest-paid actresses globally at times, earning up to $20 million for a single job.</p><p>As of this writing, Angelina Jolie’s net worth is $120 million. Angelina gets between $20 and $30 million per year from film earnings and endorsements in a regular year. For instance, Angelina made $35 million between June 2019 and June 2020.</p><h2>Angelina Jolie Money Problems</h2><p>Angelina claimed to be cash-strapped and wanted further financial help from Brad Pitt in August 2018 as part of their nasty divorce fight. According to court filings, Pitt gave Jolie $8 million as a down payment for the $25 million Cecil B.</p><p>Demille’s estate because she lacked the finances. Angelina is likely to have substantial cash stashed away in trusts and investments.</p><p>When Pitt and Jolie married in 2014, they decided that they would not require a prenup because both were entering the marriage with “over $100 million.”</p><p>So, where has Angelina Jolie’s money gone? One explanation is that she did not want to sacrifice her assets to purchase a new property knowing that Pitt would probably supply the finances.</p><p>Additionally, between August 2017 and August 2018, Angelina earned $28 million in salary and endorsements, making her the world’s second-highest-paid actress.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Angelina-Jolie-Net-Worth.jpg><h2>Angelina Jolie Childhood</h2><p>Angelina Jolie Voight was born in Los Angeles, California, on June 4, 1975. She is the daughter of John Voight and Marcheline Bertrand, who are actresses. Jolie’s parents split in 1976, and she and her brother James Haven moved home with their mother, who abandoned her acting career to care for her children.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Angelina</a> was encouraged to pursue a career in acting by her father’s success. She had a small role in her father’s film Lookin’ to Get Out when she was five years old (1982).</p><p>When she was six years old, her mother and her live-in boyfriend relocated to Palisades, New York. Five years later, they returned to Los Angeles. She chose to pursue acting at this point and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute. She spent two years training there.</p><p>Jolie attended Beverly Hills High School for a while when she felt separated from her wealthier peers due to her family’s little money. She was ridiculed by other teenagers due to her extreme thinness and wearing glasses and braces.</p><p>Her mother attempted unsuccessfully to get her to model. She was a transfer student at Moreno High School. At this moment, she began dressing entirely in black. She shared an apartment with her partner and dabbled in knife play.</p><h2>Angelina Jolie Career</h2><p>Jolie made her feature film debut in the 1993 direct-to-video sci-fi thriller Cyborg 2, followed by the cult classic Hackers in 1995. Two years later, in 1997, she landed her breakout role in the biopic George Wallace.</p><p>She received her first Golden Globe Award, followed by another for depicting supermodel Gia Carangi in HBO’s Gia.</p><p>Jolie took home three Golden Globes, a second Screen Actors Guild Award, and her first Academy Award for her supporting performance in Girl, Interrupted.</p><p>Jolie’s versatility has landed her jobs as an action star in the Lara Croft trilogy and Mr. and Mrs. Smith, as well as a voice actor in Shark Tale and Kung-Fu Panda, the latter of which is Jolie’s most commercially successful film to date with total worldwide profits of $632 million.</p><p>In 2011, Jolie directed, wrote, and produced In the Land of Blood and Honey. Jolie returned to the cinema after a three-and-a-half-year sabbatical with Maleficent (2014), a live-action adaptation of Disney’s 1959 animated picture Sleeping Beauty.</p><p>Unbroken was written and directed by her the same year. Jolie’s next directorial attempt was the marital drama By the Sea (2015), in which she co-starred with her then-husband Brad Pitt for the first time since 2005’s Mr. & Mrs. Smith.</p><p>Jolie also co-wrote, produced, and directed the 2017 film First They Killed My Father and starred in and produced The Breadwinner.</p><p>Jolie reprised her role as Maleficent in the 2019 Disney fantasy sequel Maleficent: Mistress of Evil, which got mixed reviews from critics but performed quite well at the box office, grossing $490 million worldwide.</p><h2>Angelina Jolie Salary</h2><p>Angelina Jolie made about $120 million in film earnings between 2001 and 2011. She got $7 million for her role in the first Lara Croft film and $12 million for her role in the second.</p><p>Mr & Mrs. Smith, The Good Shepherd, and A Mighty Heart earned her a combined $10 million. Her compensation increased to $15 million for Wanted, $20 million for Salt, and $19 million for The Tourist.</p><h2>Angelina Jolie Private Life</h2><p>Jolie met Jonny Lee Miller in 1995 and married him in March 1996 on the set of Hackers. Rather than a traditional wedding gown, Jolie donned black rubber trousers and a white t-shirt on which she had inscribed her groom’s name in blood. They divorced the next year.</p><p>After dating for two months, Jolie’s divorce was finalized just before she married actor Billy Bob Thornton in Las Vegas on May 5, 2000. They met on the set of Pushing Tin in 1999.</p><p>The pair were well-known for their public displays of affection, including wearing vials of one another’s blood around their necks.</p><p>In March 2002, Jolie and Thornton adopted a son, Maddox, from Cambodia. They unexpectedly parted ways three months later. On May 27, 2003, their divorce was completed.</p><p>Jolie was accused of orchestrating Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston’s October 2005 divorce. She said she fell in love with Pitt while the two were filming Mr. & Mrs. Smith in 2005.</p><p>They made their relationship public in January 2006, when she confirmed her pregnancy with his kid. Jolie and Pitt dated for twelve years. Six children were born into their family, three of them were adopted. On August 23, 2014, Jolie and Pitt were married.</p><p>They ended their relationship in September 2016. Their divorce and custody fight dragged on for years. On April 12, 2019, their divorce was finalized.</p><p><strong>Also read:</strong></p><h3>Residential Real Estate</h3><p>Angelina spent $24.5 million on a property in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, in June 2017. At the time, it was approximate twice the neighborhood’s previous record price.</p><p>The mansion is located in the gated enclave of Laughlin Park, just five minutes from Brad Pitt’s Bronson Canyon estate. Cecil B. Demille lived on the 2-acre estate from 1913 to 1959.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpa2dgaHx0fI6apaCdnJ67onnJqKOinV2jsrV51qipraBf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jax-and-brittany-divorce.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Are Jax Taylor and Brittany Cartwright Getting Divorced?
