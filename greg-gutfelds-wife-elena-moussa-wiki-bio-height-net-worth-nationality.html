Her husband is a television personality and is best known as the host of the Fox News Channel program entitled “The Greg Gutfeld Show”. He previously hosted “Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld”.</p><h2><span id=The_Wealth_of_Elena_Moussa>The Wealth of Elena Moussa</span></h2><p>How rich is Elena Moussa? As of early-2019, sources inform us of a net worth that is at $2 million, earned through success in her various endeavors. Her wealth has also likely been elevated in partnership with her husband, who has an estimated net worth at $4 million. As she continues her career, it is expected that his wealth will also continue to increase.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_and_Education>Early Life and Education</span></h2><p>At a young age, Elena discovered a strong interest in fashion, leading her to try and pursue a path towards the industry. Little is known about her family and her childhood, but after matriculating from high school, she enrolled at New York’s Fashion Institute of Technology. Prior to her enrolling in college, the family had moved to London from Russia and she later moved to the United States for college.</p><p>She then returned to Russia after her education was completed, and started working as a model. She had the looks and the height required for her to have success in the field. She transitioned to working for Maxim Russia as a photo editor, so that she could gain more insight and experience. While working with the company, she frequented London to also work with Maxim UK, and it was during this period that she met Greg Gutfeld.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/affairpost.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/elena-moussa-is-a-stunning-russian-lady-better-known-as-the-wife-of-greg-gutfeld.jpg><h2><span id=Husband_Greg_Gutfeld>Husband – Greg Gutfeld</span></h2><p><a rel=nofollow href=#>Greg</a> developed a strong inclination towards politics by the time he was enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, stating that his time there was responsible for a drastic change in his political thinking. After an internship at “The American Spectator”, he started working as a staff writer for the magazine “Prevention”. In 1995, he joined as a staff writer for “Men’s Health”, and was promoted to become editor after four years, staying with the company for another &nbsp;year, before moving to “Stuff”, with responsibility for helping the publication grow.</p><p>In 2004, he began editing “Maxim” magazine in the UK, where he met his future wife. He was also one of the initial contributors to “The Huffington Post”, from its launch in 2005 up to 2008. Many of his posts are still available on the website, and he also maintains a blog called “The Daily Gut”. In 2007, he became the host of his own late night program called “<a rel=nofollow href=#>Red Eye with Greg Gutfeld</a>” and would manage the show for the next eight years, while also becoming a co-host of “The Five”. In 2015, he decided to leave his show to work on a new weekend show which was launched a few months later, called “The Greg Gutfeld Show”.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr><a rel=nofollow href=#>@greggutfeld</a> ‘s hair today <a rel=nofollow href=#>pic.twitter.com/eUpEyjaHxN</a></p><p>— Elena Moussa (@ElenaMoussa) <a rel=nofollow href=#>April 7, 2013</a></p><h2><span id=Relationship_and_Marriage>Relationship and Marriage</span></h2><p>According to an interview with Greg, the moment he saw Moussa in the UK, he <a rel=nofollow href=#>asked</a> the editor of “Maxim Russia” about her identity; he asked her on a date and the relationship began there. She quickly agreed to move to London to be with him, and after just five months of dating, the two married in late 2004 in a civil ceremony in New York; a few details were shared through his book entitled “Lessons from the Land of Port Scratchings: A Miserable Yank Finds Happiness in the UK” published in 2008.</p><p>Despite being together for a long time, the two don’t have any children of their own. They stay married, and she spends a lot of time with her family or her friends as seen online. The couple also take advantage of the time they have by travelling as much as possible together, including to beaches around the country. They also frequent various arts exhibitions, and take international trips from time to time.</p><p>?</p><p>Posted by <a rel=nofollow href=#>Elena Moussa</a> on&nbsp;<a rel=nofollow href=#>Tuesday, August 4, 2015</a></p><h2><span id=Current_Endeavors_and_Social_Media>Current Endeavors and Social Media</span></h2><p>While Elena has left her journalism and modelling career behind, her passion for fashion design remains fully active. In 2011 she established her own company called Moussa Project, which displays some of her clothing designs for sale, having taken her experiences from the Fashion Institute of Technology, as well as lessons from the Parsons School of Design. Her company has its own social media pages, including a Facebook page which has attracted thousands of ‘likes’. It also has its own Instagram page which is used to display some of her fashion designs, and Elena even models in some of the pictures.</p><p>Similar to numerous fashion industry personalities, she has activity online through several major social media accounts, such as Facebook and Twitter. While her Twitter account has been there since 2011, she does not often post on it, even occasions years between her posts; her last post was in 2017 when she posted a photo of her husband. The same can be said for her Facebook account which has not posted any new content since 2016, prior which she had posted a few photos with friends. It is likely that she is focused on other endeavors, and has not given much attention to her social media.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOoKmen12cwrWyxKWbrGWnnrOmecSlnKeZXaK8tr%2FSmmSwoZueeqO1zmafnqGXncFuusStZLCnoqm1brrAraCoppGhtrXFjg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./scott-disick-troubling-health-problems.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Heartbreaking Details About Scott Disick's Troubling Health Problems">&larr;
