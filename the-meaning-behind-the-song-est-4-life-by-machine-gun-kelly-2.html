One song that has always stood out to me is “EST 4 Life” by Machine Gun Kelly. I first heard this song when it was released in 2012, and it immediately caught my attention with its raw energy and powerful lyrics.</p><p>“EST 4 Life” is a track dedicated to the famous EST movement (EveryoneStandsTogether) created by Machine Gun Kelly. It serves as a representation of the loyalty and unity that the artist shares with his fans, also known as the EST gang. The song’s lyrics reflect the determination and hustle that Machine Gun Kelly and his crew embody as they navigate the music industry.</p><p>The opening lines of the song set the tone for the rest of the track, with Machine Gun Kelly declaring, “Let’s bring some reality to it, And the whole gang’s in here.” This introduction immediately grabs the listener’s attention and establishes the sense of camaraderie that exists within the EST community.</p><p>The song’s first verse, performed by Machine Gun Kelly and Dub-O, highlights the artists’ relentless work ethic and desire for success. They rap about hustling for 40 days and nights, the loyalty of their crew, and their rise from humble beginnings. The lyrics also emphasize the impact they have made in the music industry, with lines like, “EST we shut it down, All them bitches know what’s up, EST we run it now.”</p><p>The chorus of “EST 4 Life” serves as a powerful anthem for Machine Gun Kelly and his dedicated fanbase. With the repeated chant of “EST (What the fuck?)” the artist expresses his unwavering commitment to his craft and his city, Cleveland. The lyrics also reflect the pride and love they have for the streets they come from, as well as the loyalty they have towards their team.</p><p>Machine Gun Kelly’s second verse showcases his signature aggressive and passionate delivery. He raps about his hometown, Cleveland, and the struggles and hardships faced by its residents. The lyrics convey a sense of rebellion and resilience, as well as the desire to overcome obstacles and prove oneself. The verse also addresses the haters and critics, asserting that they will continue to rise above them.</p><p>The outro of the song, delivered by DJ Xplosive, further reinforces the EST movement and the bond between Machine Gun Kelly and his fans. It emphasizes the unity and loyalty within the group, as well as their enduring dedication to their music. The outro invites listeners to join the EST community and encourages them to embrace their individuality.</p><p>“EST 4 Life” is a powerful and anthemic song that resonates with fans and reflects the spirit and perseverance of Machine Gun Kelly and the EST movement. Its energetic and honest lyrics, coupled with its catchy chorus, make it a standout track in Machine Gun Kelly’s discography. This song serves as a testament to the artist’s journey and his unwavering commitment to his city, his fans, and his craft.</p><p>As a music promoter, I am always drawn to artists who create music with a deeper meaning and a strong connection to their audience. Machine Gun Kelly’s “EST 4 Life” perfectly embodies these qualities, making it an exceptional song that continues to inspire and motivate listeners.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminnJnBqrnEpqysoZNjsLC5jq2fnmWdmq6vtc2gZJudmJ67pXnToZxmq5%2BjtG6x0q1kbWWcnrOmecGyZKaZk522r7GMoKynZZuaua3FjGtm</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-meaning-behind-the-song-thats-whats-up-intro-by-yo-gotti.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Meaning Behind The Song: Thats Whats Up (Intro) by Yo Gotti">&larr;
