Her father, Jason, has released ten albums and forty singles since being signed to Broken Bow Records. His albums “Kinda Party” (2010) and “Night Train” (2012) are certified quadruple-platinum and double-platinum, respectively, by the Recording Industry Association.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, Rome’s mother, Brittany, appeared in season 11 of the famous singing show American Idol. Despite being born in a renowned household, there isn’t much information regarding Navy. However, fans are curious about the adorable celebrity kid due to her parent’s fame.</p><p>Many have asked how old she is, if she has a twin, and if she will follow in her parent’s footsteps. Here’s everything we know about her.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/photo_2023-09-13_03-53-17-fotor-2023091341039.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Navy_Rome_Williams></span>Who Is Navy Rome Williams?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As earlier stated, Navy Rome Williams is a celebrity child. She was born in Nashville, United States, to her parents, Jason Aldean and Brittany Kerr Aldean. At the time of her birth, Navy weighed about 7 lbs and 12 oz, and to express their happiness towards having a newborn, the then-new parents took to Instagram to announce the birth of their newborn baby.</p><p>Regarding her ethnicity, Navy Rome Williams is of Caucasian descent, and she is the granddaughter of Barry Aldean and Debbie Aldean from her father’s side and Donald Kerr and Debbie Kerr from her mother’s side.</p><p>Despite being a celebrity child, she rarely appears in the limelight, and her parents shield her from the media’s prying eyes. Consequently, most details about her elude the public.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=When_Is_Navy_Rome_Williams_Birthday></span>When Is Navy Rome Williams’ Birthday?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Navy Rome Williams was born on February 4, 2019. Hence, she is four years old as of 2023, and her birth sign is Aquarius. Therefore, she celebrates her birthday yearly on&nbsp; February 4.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_Did_Jason_Aldean_Name_His_Daughter_Navy_Rome_Williams></span>Why Did Jason Aldean Name His Daughter Navy Rome Williams?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The 4-year-old celebrity kid has quite a unique name, and during an interview with SiriusXM, the “Don’t You Wanna Stay” singer spoke about how he and his partner came up with the name. He said they initially had the name “Roman” for Navy’s elder brother, Memphis. However, he didn’t like the name, so when Brittany came up with “Navy,” he liked it.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, the famous country singer said that his name was so common growing up and that there were five Jasons in his class, which he thought was annoying. Consequently, he wanted his kids to have names that weren’t weird but were different enough. Hence, he and Brittany came up with unique names for their kids.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Does_Navy_Rome_Williams_Have_a_Twin></span>Does Navy Rome Williams Have a Twin?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Contrary to what many believe, no, she doesn’t. Her brother, Memphis Aldean Williams, was born on December 1, 2017. Hence, he is the eldest son of Jason Aldean and Brittany Kerr Aldean.</p><p>Many often ask if Navy and Memphis are twins, but they are not. However, their mom mentioned they could’ve been twins, as both were born via IVF. The former “American Idol” contestant added that she and her partner considered putting their kids together.</p><p>She said, “FUN FACT: Both of our babies are IVF babies. We almost put Memphis and Navy in simultaneously because, after our long infertility journey, multiples seemed AMAZING to me,” she wrote. She added that her husband talked her out of it, and they had Memphis first.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/photo_2023-09-13_03-52-53-fotor-2023091341310.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Many_Siblings_Does_Jason_Aldeans_Daughter_Have></span>How Many Siblings Does Jason Aldean’s Daughter Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Navy Rome Williams has three siblings. Aside from Memphis, Navy also has two other half-siblings from her father’s previous relationship with Jessica Ann Ussery. The former couple became parents to their daughter Keeley Ann Williams on February 14, 2003. Afterward, they welcomed another daughter, Kendyl Aldean Williams, four years later, on August 20, 2007.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Navy_Rome_Williams_Parents_Meet></span>How Did Navy Rome Williams’ Parents Meet?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Navy’s parents crossed paths in September 2012 at a bar, and their meeting was controversial. At the time, Jason was drunk and couldn’t think for himself. So, in the heat of the moment, he got cozy with the former American Idol contestant. However, the paparazzi caught his behavior, and rumors started circulating about the singer having an affair with Brittany while he was still married to his first wife, Jessica.</p><p>Consequently, the country singer admitted that he acted shamefully a month later and took to social media to apologize to his fans. However, Jason’s family of four was having a blast until he filed for divorce from his then-wife on April 26, 2013, citing irreconcilable differences.&nbsp;</p><p>After the divorce, Jason ironically started dating <a href=#>Brittany Kerr</a>, the woman the media assumed he was having an affair with after the bar incident. The duo first appeared together at the 2014 CMT Awards. Likewise, in September 2014, the then-boyfriend and girlfriend announced their engagement.&nbsp;</p><p>Afterward, they became husband and wife on March 21, 2015, following their wedding ceremony in Mexico. The lovebirds have been together for more than seven years and have become parents to two kids during these seven years.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/photo_2023-09-13_03-53-05-fotor-2023091341217.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Is_Navy_Rome_Williams_Net_Worth></span>What Is Navy Rome Williams’ Net Worth?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Like most celebrity kids her age, Navy Rome Williams does not have a career yet. Hence, she doesn’t have a net worth. However, her famous father has a net worth of $80 million from his career as a country music singer.&nbsp;</p><p>Like <a href=#>Story Grey Jeter</a>, Navy Rome Williams is a kid in her formative years. Her parents shield her from the public eye and want her to have a normal childhood. Consequently, her early interests remain elusive, and it is unclear if she will follow in her father’s footsteps.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ku6LC2GapqKWVYsSquMuimKarXaKypsCMo5isp55irq2wxJqlrGWppMKvs8Ssq2ackaq0qcDEq2Y%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nicoye-banks-net-worth-income-salary-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nicoye Banks  Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?">&larr;
