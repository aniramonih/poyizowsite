During his early years, he decided not to pursue college to enter the 2004 NBA draft during which he was first selected by the Orlando Magic. Debuting as a professional with the Magic turned out to be a great start for Howard as he was able to reign as one of the most competent players, receiving multiple awards in a row, and leading his team to the NBA Finals in 2009. As of July 2019, he is an eight-time All-Star, eight-time All-NBA Team honoree, three-time Defensive Player of the Year, five-time All-Defensive Team member, and one of the few players who had acquired multiple franchises and league records during his playing career with the Magic.</p><p>After 8 seasons, he was traded to Los Angeles Lakers in 2012 but later played for Houston Rockets, Atlanta Hawks, Charlotte Hornets, and Washington Wizards after finishing one season with the Lakers. Howard signed with the Washington Wizards on July 12, 2018, but only appeared in 9 games in November due to his backside injury and spinal surgery that was done to relieve pain in his glutes. On July 6, 2019, he was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies for C. J. Miles.</p><h3>Born Name</h3><p>Dwight David Howard</p><h3>Nick Name</h3><p>D-12</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Dwight-Howard-with-his-pet-snake-as-seen-in-February-2017.jpg><h3>Sun Sign</h3><p>Sagittarius</p><h3>Born Place</h3><p>Atlanta, Georgia, United States</p><h3>Nationality</h3><p><img decoding=async title=American src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/healthyceleb.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/United-States.png alt=American width=64 height=47 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3></h3><h3>Education</h3><p>He went to <strong>Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy</strong>.
