Who is John Linson’s wife?</p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>John Linson is a well-known American film and television producer and has produced top-rated TV series and films, including Yellowstone, Outlaw Country, The Runaways, Sons of Anarchy, Lords of Dogtown, and Great Expectations.</p><h2><strong>The Origin Story</strong></h2><p>Linson was born in Los Angeles, California, the United States, into a prominent film family.</p><p>He was heavily influenced to pursue a career in film by his childhood upbringing.</p><p>His father, Art Linson, was also a film producer who worked on a myriad of films and television shows, including “Scrooged,” “1883: The Road West,” “Heist,” “Spartan,” “Sons of Anarchy,” and “Into The Wild,” among many others.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-53529 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/John-Linson-and-father-Art-Linson.jpg.webp alt="John Linson and father Art Linson" width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/John-Linson-and-father-Art-Linson.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-2 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-53529 class=wp-caption-text>John Linson and Art Linson – @Getty</p><p>His father, who is known as one of Hollywood’s greatest film producers of this era, rubbed elbows with some of the most elite celebrities in America, which also played a pivotal role in Linson’s decision to pursue his career.</p><p>Growing up, he spent a lot of his time around producers,&nbsp;actors, directors, screenwriters, and any other persons who took part in the making of films and television shows.</p><p>Therefore, his entire childhood was a training lesson for what was to come next in his life.</p><p>There is no public information regarding Linson’s post-secondary credentials. He likely wouldn’t have needed it, considering the invaluable mentorship he received from his father and the people he would have naturally associated with throughout his life.</p><p>And despite working with some of Hollywood’s most prominent faces, he manages to maintain a highly private life.</p><h2><strong>First Project</strong></h2><p>When Linson took the leap and began working on projects independent of his father, he stepped into the producing arena and began working on music videos – a common starting point for all many aspiring producers.</p><p>One of his first known projects was dated back to 1996, when he worked with the American alternative band Porno for Pyros to produce the music video “Tahitian Moon.”</p><p>This project was an aid in building his name throughout the entertainment world, and he quickly landed many more projects to work on.</p><p>He helped produce the video for Nirvana’s “Live at the Paramount,” which, of course, was a household hit considering how big of a band Nirvana was at the time.</p><p>He was also hired by the 80’s hairband Guns N’ Roses to produce their first documentary titled “Guns N’ Roses Don’t Cry: Makin’ F@*!ing Videos.”</p><p>And what a job well done this was, considering how brilliant feedback it garnered from its viewers. It went on to receive a score of 86% on IMDb and is still a regularly streamed documentary, after two decades of being released.</p><p>Well, if Linson could produce highly-rated music videos and documentaries, what would stop him from pursuing a career in television and film. Nothing stopped him because that is what he has had his eye set on since he was a child, and that was his next step.</p><h2><strong>First Major Film Production</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-53530 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/what-is-the-net-worth-of-John-Linson.jpg.webp alt width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/what-is-the-net-worth-of-John-Linson.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-3 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-53530 class=wp-caption-text>Stacy Peralta and John Linson – @Getty</p><p>In 1998, he was invited to join prominent film director Alfonso Cuaron to work on his next project.</p><p>The two teamed up and together created the film “Great Expectations.” The film went on to do very well, and it was at this point where Linson became well-known as a producer in his own right, completely independent of his father.</p><p>Since this breakthrough project, he went on to work on a host of films, including “Lords of Dogtown” alongside Ameican director, Catherine Hardwicke, followed by “The Runaways” alongside Floria Sigismondi.</p><p>This was another huge breakthrough for the up-and-coming producer as it went on to be named the <a href=# rel=noopener>#1 rock film of all time by none of than Rolling Stone magazine</a>.</p><h2><strong>Sons of Anarchy</strong></h2><p>One of his most prominent accomplishments in television is his participation in producing the hit American television series, “Sons of Anarchy.”&nbsp;</p><p>The pilot of the show caught the attention of major production companies, and it was immediately picked up.</p><p>There was no way of knowing it would go on to do as well as it did. But it went on for six very successful seasons in which Linson worked as the producer for all.</p><p>Since the television series did so well, it wasn’t only the cast that received accolades for their outstanding roles, but Linson began to be compared to his father, who was recognized as being part o the elite of the producing world.</p><h2><strong>Yellowstone</strong></h2><p>His success in the role opened the doors to many more opportunities, and he went on to partake in the making of “Yellowstone.”</p><p>The project commenced in 2018 and has gone on to become another major hit.</p><p>For the role, he teamed up with <a href=#>American screenwriter Taylor Sheridan</a> who has his own fair share of exceptional accomplishments in the television and film industry.</p><p>The show premiered on June 20, 2018, and was an immediate hit with its viewers.</p><h2><strong>The Comedian</strong></h2><p>Juggling projects is nothing new to Linson, and he’s known for producing many projects at the same time. During the filming of Sons of Anarchy, he also began a new project, “The Comedian.”</p><p>A comedy film that turned out to be one of his biggest film hits by that point.&nbsp;</p><p>The film starred Robert De Niro and Leslie Mann, who are some of Hollywood’s biggest actors, which indicates how big a project this one was for Linson.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Lauren Hobart Net Worth</a></p><h2><strong>Wife</strong></h2><p>John Linson is married to Fiona Lewis, the author of “Mistakes Were Made.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-53528 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/John-Linson-with-wife-Fiona-Lewis.jpg.webp alt="John Linson with wife Fiona Lewis" width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/John-Linson-with-wife-Fiona-Lewis.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-4 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-53528 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><h2><strong>John Linson – Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Linson earned most of his wealth from serving as the producer of Yellowstone (39 episodes) and Sons of Anarchy (92 episodes).</p><p>John was also involved in the production of 1883, The Money, and more.</p><p>Therefore, John Linson has an estimated net worth of $15 million.</p><p><strong>READ THIS NEXT:</strong> <a href=#>Who is Dee Shanell</a>?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaK8tr%2FPnqappJWpvKWt2GeaqKVfn7ypuoyloKern6N6r7HTZq6oqqSderi1xZ5m</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./jordan-johnson-hinds-height-net-worth-age-wiki-who-facts-biography-22900-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jordan Johnson-Hinds Height, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Facts, Biography">&larr;
