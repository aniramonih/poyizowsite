Read on and learn more details of her 80-pound loss.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>Actress and comedian Mo’Nique has been in people’s radars since the late 90s when she portrayed Nikki Parker in “The Parkers.” She shot to stardom in 2009 for her outstanding performance in “Precious.”</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>A few years later, Mo’Nique decided to make a crucial change in her lifestyle: she began eating healthier and exercising. Fortunately, she documented her journey on social media.</p><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>Mo'Nique on November 28, 2012 in New York City | Photo: Getty Images</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:center><strong class=Ug>MO’NIQUE’S WEIGHT-LOSS JOURNEY</strong></p><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>The Oscar-winning actress regularly <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/celebrity/moniques-weight-loss-how-she-lost-and-kept-off-82lbs/>posted photos</a> on Twitter doing different things, including lifting weights, boxing, hiking, and even hula-hooping. In the caption, she would write funny or motivational messages for her followers.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>Back in May 2013, months after Mo’Nique began posting about her weight-loss journey, she uploaded an <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/moworldwide/status/337552819408232448>image</a> from the gym lifting a medicine ball.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>The following January, the actress shared <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://twitter.com/moworldwide/status/427889258607562752>more images</a> working out with gym machines, and the change in her body was not only visible but also impressive.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>Later that year, Mo’Nique explained that the journey had been amazing as it let her know what she was really made of. She named her husband and children her <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://people.com/celebrity/moniques-weight-loss-how-she-lost-and-kept-off-82lbs/>main motivations</a>, but she also said she needed to “get out of [her] own way.”</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>In only one year, Mo’Nique hit the 218-pound mark. It is important to point out that she admitted she once weighed 300 pounds. As per why she uploaded photos of her exercises, she <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/inside-moniques-80-pound-weight-loss/story?id=22861362">said</a>:</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>“I tweet every morning because I want women to see – especially us big women – that you don't have to let them cut you and suck it out."</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:center><strong class=Ug>PROUD MOMENTS</strong></p><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>Fortunately, Mo’Nique has kept those pounds off over the years, and she has not stopped working out or eating healthy. In August 2019, she achieved a <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.essence.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/monique-gets-emaotional-sharing-fitness-journey-weight-loss/>significant fitness milestone</a> and shared online how proud she was.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>In her <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/B0y-oNKBYmE/>Instagram video</a>, the “Bessie” star appeared in front of a race track and explained to her followers that she could only walk half of it and run the other half when she began running there.</p><h3 style=text-align:justify class=ah><strong class=Ug>[Mo’Nique] and her husband, Sydney Hicks, were in an open relationship.</strong></h3><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>Mo’Nique was so focused on her journey that she told her trainer she “one day” would run the same track twice without stopping. “Well, today was that day,” admitted the actress as she got emotional.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>She also urged her followers to never quit on themselves as things don’t come overnight or through a “magic potion” but from the heart.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>Mo’Nique’s physique made headlines again on August 1, 2021, when she <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.instagram.com/p/CSCInp2LyXi/>posted a photo</a> from the Helton Creek Falls in Georgia wearing a predominantly purple tracksuit.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>In the image, the actress appeared flashing her smile at the camera while standing on a rock. Her stunning figure and the beautiful falling water in the background were the post’s highlights.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>Most of Mo’Nique’s followers praised her looks, but one even wrote that the actress “transformed,” and that hard work looked great on her.</p><p class=Yi data-testid=image-source>Fans comment on Mo'Nique's Instagram post from August 1, 2021 | Photo: Instagram/therealmoworldwide</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:center><strong class=Ug>MO’NIQUE’S FAMILY</strong></p>Read also<a class="ae -U Tc" data-class=post-list-post href=#><h2 class=Rc>'Obese' Girl Sheds a Staggering 200LBS to Look like Barbie & Finally Fulfils Her Childhood Dream</h2></a><a class="ae -U Tc" data-class=post-list-post href=#><h2 class=Rc>Oprah Winfrey at 212 Lbs Was Crying & Praying at a 'Fat Farm' When One Call ‘Changed’ Her Life Forever</h2></a><a class="ae -U Tc" data-class=post-list-post href=#><h2 class=Rc>Jill Scott's Weight Loss: The Singer Once Lost 63 Pounds & Prioritized Physical Fitness for Her Son's Sake</h2></a><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>While Mo’Nique’s weight-loss journey has never ceased to impress, it is not the only aspect of her life that has made some headlines. In 2006, she confessed she and her husband, Sydney Hicks, were in an <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.essence.com/news/monique-sets-record-straight-her-open-marriage-new-podcast-it-was-my-idea/>open relationship</a>.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>Apart from saying that it was not Hicks' idea but hers, Mo’Nique explained she wanted an open marriage because she didn’t want to stop seeing the men she was involved with before Hicks.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>Unfortunately, people started attacking their relationship claiming that being polygamous was against God. Others believed that Hicks was using the actress. They eventually decided to have a monogamous relationship.</p><p class=Wg style=text-align:justify>Her broken bond with her eldest son, <a class="ae -U" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://madamenoire.com/518831/monique-blames-career-for-strained-relationship-with-son-my-prayer-was-please-give-me-another-chance/>Shalon Jackson</a>, has also made headlines. <a class="ae -U" href=#>Mo’Nique</a>, who was recently accused of cyber-bullying a woman at an airport, once explained things turned sour between the two because she was out chasing fame when Jackson was a boy. Being in showbiz is not easy.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmttcm9gZ3q0scRmpKimmabCpnnFpZiupqSeu6h5zairopuVlq%2BtsYywnKKfmKl7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./siara-sanchez-car-accident-update-four-brawley-union-high-school-students-died.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Siara Sanchez Car Accident Update, Four Brawley Union High School Students Died - SarkariResult">&larr;
