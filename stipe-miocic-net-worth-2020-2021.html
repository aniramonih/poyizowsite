Today Stipe Miocic is a popular professional mixed martial artist with a net worth in millions.</p><p>Maybe you know about Stipe Miocic very well, but do you know how old and tall is he and what is his net worth in 2024? If you do not know, we have prepared this article about details of Stipe Miocic’s short biography-wiki, career, professional life, personal life, today’s net worth, age, height, weight, and more facts. Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life & Biography</h2><p>Stipe Miocic was born to Kathy Miocic and Bojan Miočić on 19 August 1982. At the young age of three, Miocic had to undergo the unfortunate truth of his parents’ divorce, with his father returning to his native Croatia. Thereafter it was a tough childhood where his mother toiled hard to give Miocic the best possible childhood. Till date, in his interviews, Miocic acknowledges that the inspiration and the key to his success is his mother.</p><p>Miocic studied in Eastlake North High School, but more than academics, he took an interest in all types of sports, be it baseball, basketball, wrestling, or even football. Though he was good in sports, he wanted to be a fire-fighter and, in 2010, went to the Cleveland Fire-fighting station and trained for 18 months before joining the force in the role of a paramedic.</p><p>It was just a chance that he decided to take part in local Ohio MMA promotions, winning five knockouts. This win gave Miocic the boost to take up MMA more seriously though he decided to part-time as a firefighter-paramedic.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>Stipe Miocic met Ryan Marie Carney through a firefighter friend in 2013. She was a hairstylist and cosmetology instructor as well as a nurse, and their mutual interest in saving people and doing something for the society brought them closer together.&nbsp; After dating for three-and-a-half years, Stipe Miocic married to Ryan Marie Carney on 18 June 2016. Ever since the couple started dating, they had been vocal about their relationship, and social media posts clearly indicate that their relationship is rock solid. Two years into their marriage, they welcomed their daughter Meelah Claire Miocic on 25 July 2018.</p><p>Unlike many celebrity wives, Ryan has been extremely outspoken about her relationship with Stipe. She also gives candid interviews sharing opinions about her husband and his career. Also, she is a regular spectator at her husband’s fights being the most charged in the crowd, cheering her husband on.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 19 August 1982, Stipe Miocic is 41 years old as of today’s date 21st July 2024. His height is 1.95 m tall, and his weight is 111 kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>What started almost like a fluke became a primary profession for Stipe Miocic. &nbsp;He won the ‘NAAFS Heavyweight Championship’ and was immediately noticed by the UFC officials in 2011. Soon after, he was signed up by UFC in June 2011. His first fight was against Joey Beltran in October 2011, for which he trained tirelessly and eventually won through an anonymous decision after a very close encounter.</p><p>His second encounter was with Phil De Fries, four months from his first UFC victory in February 2012. Stipe Miocic stunned the audience by knocking out Phil, who was the stronger opponent in the first round itself.&nbsp; He won the ‘Knockout of the Night’ award, becoming a name to reckon within the field of MMA. Even the next UFC ended with him stealing a win over Shane Del Rosario. But Stefan Struve beat him in the next UFC, though it was not all a disappointment as the judges awarded ‘Fight of the Night’ honor to both of them for the intensity of the fight. His UFC glory continued as he defeated Roy Nelson, Gabriel Gonzaga, and Fabio Daldonado.</p><p>In his next two fights, against Roy Nelson and Gabriel Gonzaga, Stipe won both times, via anonymous decisions and in a May 2014 fight against Fabio Daldonado, Stipe rained punches after punches on his opponent, and won the contest in the first round, in just a matter of a few minutes. He also received the ‘Performance of the Night’ bonus for that fight. But in December 2014, he lost to Junior dos Santos in a tough match, with him losing but being honored with ‘Fight of the Night.’</p><p>But this set back was short-lived as in May 2015, and Stipe Miocic set a new record with a striking score of 361-48 against Mark Hunt. This was followed by wins against Andrei Arlovski in January 2016, Fabricio Werdum in May 2016, and Alistair Overeem in September 2016.</p><p>Even though he is a celebrity and an MMA professional, Miocic prefers to continue as a part-time firefighter-paramedic in Oakwood and Valley View, Ohio. He has said in his interviews that after he retires from MMA, he will take this up as his full-time career.</p><h2>Awards & Achievements</h2><p>Miocic holds the record of winning nine fight-night bonus awards. He is now NAAFS World Heavyweight Champion. He has won several honors for his fights such as ‘Performance of the Night,’ ‘Fight of the Night,’ and ‘Knockout of the Night.’ He is ranked fourth in the ‘UFC Heavyweight Champion’ in his weight category.</p><h2>Net Worth & Salary of Stipe Miocic in 2024</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.wealthypersons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Stipe-Miocic-Net-Worth.jpg><p>The MMA championships and fights are Stipe Miocic’s primary source of income.

Stipe Miocic continues to be a grounded, humble human being even after having attained celebrity status.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLHApauhsaCav7S7zaxlnKedZMC1tc%2BeZKahn5i2pHnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal5kWlpaWViZX9yew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./studio-666-jason-trost-as-tech-is-he-blind-in-his-right-eye-facts-to-know.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Studio 666: Jason Trost As Tech- Is He Blind In His Right Eye?
