She is best known as the executive chairwoman, designer, and CEO of her self-made company named Kendra Scott, LLC. Today, she has expanded her work and has become one of the billionaires in the industry. She has also been honored with Ernst & Young’s National Entrepreneur of the Year.</p><h3>Early Life</h3><p>Kendra Scott was born on 27th March 1974 and spent her childhood in Kenosha, Wisconsin. While she was 16 years old, Kendra and her family moved to Houston, Texas. There, she did her graduation from Klein High School. While being at such a young age where people generally possess high fantasies, Kendra fell in love and followed a boy. Due to this, she went to Texas A&M University where she studied for at least one year before dropping out and finally moving to Austin, Texas. She was 19 years old at the time when she moved to Austin with her ill stepfather. Kendra Scott opened her business with the title “The Hat Box”, specializing in comfortable hats and designs for women going through chemotherapy. Later, Scott sold “comfortable but stylish” pieces and donated another portion to cancer research.</p><h3>Kendra Scott Career</h3><p>Scott thought of starting her own business, but, before that, she started making her jewelry from home in Austin, Texas. She founded her business with the name Kendra Scott LLC in 2002. Kendra first started with the collection of merely $500 in her bedroom after her oldest son was born. She then walked store to store around Austin to sell boutiques. At last, she had to cope with the situation to cover the orders. She sold her samples to purchase enough material. In 2005, Scott’s designs were chosen for Oscar de la Renta’s spring 2006 runway show. Her designs also appeared at another runway show of 2007 by Randolph Duke. There was a time when she had to close her business in 2007 due to the financial crisis.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u82ae13b873c8c34852d39b3a6308369a><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Kitt Shapiro Biography</span></a><p>But, she received an order from Nordstrom which turned out to be a great hit for her business. She got the opportunity to expose and expand her business. Scott opened her first retail store in Austin’s South Congress Avenue in 2010. In the same year, she began her e-commerce business. Later in 2011, Scott opened another store on Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills. But, soon she had to close it. In 2014, Scott opened her stores around the South and Midwest. In 2016, Scott sold a minority of the stakes of her company to a private equity firm at the value of $1 billion. At that time, her business was valued at $1 billion and consisted of a few fashion lines like fine jewelry, home accessories, beauty products, and fashion jewelry.</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Kendra Scott Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Kendra L Baumgartner</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>27 March 1974</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2021)</td><td>47 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Kenosha, Wisconsin, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Fashion Designer</td></tr><tr><td>Religion</td><td>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td>Sun sign</td><td>Aries</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kendra-Scott-2.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 5’ 5” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 165 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 55 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 121 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Shoe Size</td><td>6.5 (U.S.)</td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Body Type</td><td>Slim</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>Rob</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Qualification/Education</h3></th></tr><tr><td>School</td><td>Klein High School</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>Texas A&M University</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td style=text-align:center colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Kendra-Scott-3.jpg alt width=960 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>Divorced</td></tr><tr><td>Affair</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Is she a Lesbian?</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Husband</td><td>Matt Davis&nbsp;(m. 2014–2020)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Three (Cade Scott, Beck Scott, Grey Davis)</td></tr></tbody></table><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ucaaca572c4ed4007c82d5149a9d36a00><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Justin Derrico Biography</span></a><h3>Personal Life</h3><p>Kendra has married two times in her life.

Although she runs a billion-dollar business single-handedly, she has learned two of her life lessons. Her second marriage didn’t work for her and she had to divorce her second husband in September 2020.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=u63b2787d44585bca2da0282537aa91c4><span class=ctaText>Read Also:</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Brittany Renner Biography</span></a><h3>Kendra Scott Net Worth</h3><p>Kendra Scott is a self-made billion-dollar businesswoman.
