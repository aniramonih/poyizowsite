When Hulk's agent gave him a choice between a grill and another product – Hulk Hogan chose the other product.&nbsp; The grill went to another sports figure – <strong>George Foreman</strong>.&nbsp; Fast-forward to today, and the "<strong>George Foreman Grill</strong>" is one of the best-selling products in history.&nbsp; Hulk Hogan's product?&nbsp; Yeah, not so much.&nbsp; Hulk's misguided decision caused him miss out on <strong>$200 million</strong>.
