Ever since she got married to Ralph, she has maintained a low profile. It has been noticed that she is not active on any of the social media platforms.

Of course, her husband Ralph Macchio is of European descent as his father has Italian and Greek roots while his mother has Italian ancestry.</p><h2><strong>What Does Phyllis Fierro Do For a Living?</strong></h2><p>Phyllis Fierro is a nurse practitioner.

The duo met as teenagers when they were in high school during the 16th birthday party of one of Ralph’s cousins. At that time, Ralph was 15 years old. The actor noted that Phyllis was his cousin’s friend whom he fell in love with at first sight. Records have it that Ralph began taking dance classes at the age of 3 and started performing with a local dance crew before he clocked 16 years old. Therefore, he was relatively popular when he met Phyllis.</p><p>Ralph and Phyllis dated all through high school and tied their marital knot 10 years after their meeting. They were 15 and 16 years of age, respectively, when they first met; indeed, as teenagers, it couldn’t have been anything else but love at first sight.

However, Phyllis and Ralph have been able to remain married for a long time despite all the odds, including one of which Ralph described as himself being used to “one foot in, one foot out.” The couple who have been married for 36 years have found a way to make their love strong enough to withstand any hardship. In an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>interview with People TV</a>, Ralph mentioned that his long-term partner has been more than supportive, especially in filling the gap when he is absent due to his job.</p><p>In their home, Phyllis has been the support system of her husband in creating a balance between his work life and being a family man. He noted that without Phyllis and without the foundation they had laid down and the family they established, it would have been difficult to maintain the one-foot-in, one-foot-out relationship he has in Hollywood. The actor states that without Phyllis, there would not have been a balance in their marriage. He credited both of them for their commitment to the marriage. He especially commended his wife for being by his side all the whole time.</p><p>Also, speaking about their commitment to each other, the actor disclosed that in both difficult and hard times, and through all they have encountered, he believes that they are meant to be together.</p><h2><strong>Phyllis and Raph Macchio are Parents To Two Children&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>The union of the duo has been blessed with two children: a male and a female.
