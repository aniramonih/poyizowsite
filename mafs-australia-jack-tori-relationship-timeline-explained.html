"It's giving... controlling the narrative," she said.&nbsp;</p><p id=eXCi4tf5q4N data-wc=26>It wasn't long before the couple went on their honeymoon, and during a discussion about deal-breakers, Jack revealed that he "demands respect" from his other half.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f0e255157256-mafs-tori-jack.jpg><p id=eHT2fST8Zk0 data-wc=41>When the conversation moved to sexual compatibility, he admitted: "I've definitely had bigger sexual sparks instantly...with the mixed emotions running through my head the day I met you, I wasn't going, 'God damn, I want to get this girl in bed'."</p><h2 dir=ltr>Ex-girlfriend scandal&nbsp;</h2><p id=eWSAk7Wniml data-wc=23>At the first dinner party, it was revealed that Jack had been with his ex-girlfriend just days before tying the knot with Tori.&nbsp;</p><p id=e9E1ilXK_Qz data-wc=29>Before appearing on the show, Jack was in a relationship with Courtney Jade, who claimed in an article that he lied to her about appearing on the reality show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7aece6c1ec94-mafs-jack.jpg><p id=efwapNOSSMc data-wc=32>Jack defended himself, saying Courtney Jade was simply looking for her "three seconds of fame".

He did, however, say that he was "100 per cent ready" to move forward with her and apologised for letting her down at times.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/27234df461d3-tori-jack-vows.jpg><p id=eftggHPFzeRc data-wc=43>After the episode aired, Jack spoke out about the moment in an interview with <a class=hm-link href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Pedestrian</a> and claimed the show's producers made him change the vows "six or seven times until they kind of went down the theme of what production were looking for".</p><p id=efYvX8Zarj6Y data-wc=3><strong></strong></p><h2 dir=ltr>Jack and Tori storm out of the reunion</h2><p id=eMnLsK9G4PiI data-wc=25>The couple didn't get a huge amount of airtime during the reunion as they stormed out in the middle of their session with the experts.&nbsp;</p><p id=eg_Zx267zoNc data-wc=39>After watching a video montage of their relationship's low points across the series, Tori pulled off her microphone and left the room with Jack by her side. This was the last we saw of the couple on the programme.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Where are Jack and Tori now?&nbsp;</h2><p id=efmn0S9iF-ET data-wc=12>Despite their rocky MAFS journey, Jack and Tori are still going strong.&nbsp;</p><p id=eGPlN6f7Y8Ip data-wc=31>Taking to Instagram just days ago, Tori gushed over her other half.
