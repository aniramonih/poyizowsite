The sold-out tour was titled&nbsp;</span><span>From the Bay to the Universe</span><span>&nbsp;and included dates in countries including New Zealand and Australia.</span></p><p><span>G-Eazy has performed at notable music festivals such as&nbsp;</span><span>Electric Forest, Outer Lands, Lollapalooza,</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>Made in America.&nbsp;</span><span>the rapper is also a fashionaficionado, and in the fall of 2015 teamed up with Rare Panther to launch a line of fashion items.&nbsp;Her efforts in this regard and her sense of style earned her a GQ Magazine “Top 10 Stylists” listing&nbsp;</span><span>at New York Fashion Week.</span></p><p><span>His second studio album&nbsp;</span><span>When It’s Dark</span><span>&nbsp;was released on December 4, 2015. The album’s single&nbsp;</span><span>Me, Myself and Me</span><span>, reached #7 on the US&nbsp;</span><span>Billboard</span><span>&nbsp;100. It featured singer Bebe Rexha on the track.&nbsp;The album’s tour began in January 2016 and included venues in the United States, Europe and Australia.</span></p><p><span>In 2016, he was also featured on Britney Spear’s song&nbsp;</span><span>Do Me</span><span>&nbsp;her ninth studio album.&nbsp;The duo performed the song onstage at the&nbsp;</span><span>2016 MTV Video Music Awards</span><span>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;</span><span>iHeartRadio Music Festival</span><span>&nbsp;in the same year.</span></p><p><span>Gillum was nominated for&nbsp;</span><span>Best Hip-Hop Artist</span><span>&nbsp;at the MTV Europe Music Awards in 2016. He was also nominated for a People’s Choice Award in the&nbsp;</span><span>Favorite HipHop Artist</span><span>&nbsp;category in 2017. He won the latter.</span></p><p><span>G-Eazy released a sequel to&nbsp;</span><span>Endless Summer</span><span>&nbsp;mixtape titled&nbsp;</span><span>Endless Summer II</span><span>&nbsp;and his third studio album titled&nbsp;</span><span>The Beautiful and the Damned</span><span>&nbsp;on December 15, 2017&nbsp;</span></p><h2><strong><span>G-Eazy Height, Net Worth</span></strong></h2><p><span>This entertainer is a tall dude, standing at an intimidating height of 1.92m (6ft 4in).&nbsp;G-Eazy’s numerous albums, tours and feature films have earned him a net worth of $9 million.</span></p><h2><strong><span>dating, girlfriend</span></strong></h2><p><span>At various points in his career, G-Eazy has been rumored to date Lana del Ray and then Britney Spears.&nbsp;As early as 2011, he would also have started a relationship with singer Devon Baldwin.&nbsp;It was reported that they clicked while working on her remix of the classic&nbsp;</span><span>Runaround Sue</span><span>&nbsp;and her next music video.&nbsp;Currently, he is said to be dating a woman simply named Halsey.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGifXZquu8WMm6CoZZiatqi002auoqOZYrumwIydmK2hnpx6qLXRpZ2roZWjsW6ywKagpbFf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./giorgio-tsoukalos-wife-net-worth-married-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Giorgio Tsoukalos Wiki, Wife, Net Worth, Ethnicity">&larr;
