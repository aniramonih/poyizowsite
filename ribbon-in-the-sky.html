The opening lines depict the artist riding in his luxurious 500 Benz with no love for the people surrounding him since they are deceitful. He then expresses his disappointment in love by saying that nothing is what it seems to be, and he needs some happiness in his life. The only way for him to relieve this pain is to travel and clear his head.</p><br><p>The artist also talks about his struggles with his past and how he has to stay focused to achieve his goals since music is all he has ever wanted. He also mentions the need to be careful in the streets and the importance of having loyal friends. In the chorus, he talks about keeping his head to the ribbon in the sky, which is symbolic in the song, signifying the hope that things will get better, and he will find peace. The song ends with the artist asking for his mother's comfort, stating that he needs to talk to her as he has been struggling with his demons.</p><br><p>Overall, "Ribbon In The Sky" is about an artist's struggle with life, his mental health, and the hope for a better tomorrow.<br></p><br><a id=meaning-linebyline class=aMean href=#><span>Line by Line Meaning</span></a><a id=editlines title="Suggest Edits to Line by Line Meaning" href=#></a><br><p><u>Uh, picture me rolling in my 500 Benz</u><br>Imagine me driving in luxury</p><br><p><u>I got no love for these niggas, ain't no need to be friends</u><br>I don't have any affection for these individuals, no point in pretending to be friends</p><br><p><u>I don't fuck with these niggas, ain't no need to pretend</u><br>I don't associate with these people, no point in acting like I do</p><br><p><u>Ain't no trust in a nigga after this</u><br>I can't trust anyone after this incident</p><br><p><u>You said you love me, but you're leaving me</u><br>You claimed to love me, but now you're departing</p><br><p><u>I guess nothing's what it seem to be</u><br>I suppose that things aren't always as they appear to be</p><br><p><u>I need some happiness again, this life done beat on me</u><br>I desire some joy again, life has taken its toll on me</p><br><p><u>I caught a flight to ease the pain I switched the scenery</u><br>I took a trip to change my surroundings and alleviate my pain</p><br><p><u>Through the pain know I gotta stay focused</u><br>Despite the hardship, I must remain concentrated</p><br><p><u>'Cause since a kid this all I wanted</u><br>Because ever since I was a child, this has been my aspiration</p><br><p><u>I heard he feed his problem to the vultures</u><br>I heard he shares his issues with untrustworthy individuals</p><br><p><u>He couldn't say no more so he exploded</u><br>He reached his limit and lost his composure</p><br><p><u>Read the book on murder when she wrote it</u><br>I know the true intentions behind her actions</p><br><p><u>We hit the street with heat and we unload it</u><br>We take to the streets with firearms and use them</p><br><p><u>ATR for life, I run with soldiers</u><br>I am dedicated to ATR and associate with strong individuals</p><br><p><u>Heard he drive his coupe like he stole it</u><br>I heard he drives his car recklessly</p><br><p><u>Pray to God that I can see the morning</u><br>I ask God to allow me to witness the sunrise</p><br><p><u>And now I lay me down to sleep</u><br>As I go to bed</p><br><p><u>Pray the Lord my soul to keep</u><br>I ask God to watch over my soul</p><br><p><u>If I should die before I wake</u><br>If I pass away while asleep</p><br><p><u>I, I pray the Lord my soul to take</u><br>I ask God to take my soul should I die in my sleep</p><br><p><u>Can you hear me mama?</u><br>Mother, can you hear me?</p><br><p><u>I need you now, answer your phone</u><br>I require your assistance, please pick up the phone</p><br><p><u>It's been too much shit going on, uh</u><br>I've been dealing with too many issues lately</p><br><p><u>These demons want my soul</u><br>These inner demons are trying to take over my being</p><br><p><u>Life too short to be living in a lie</u><br>Life is too brief to pretend</p><br><p><u>I keep my head to the ribbon in the sky</u><br>I stay focused on my dreams and aspirations</p><br><p><u>Okay, ribbon in the sky</u><br>Alright, aim for the stars</p><br><p><u>Ribbon in the sky</u><br>Dream big</p><br><p><u>Life too short to be living in a lie</u><br>Life is too brief to pretend</p><br><p><u>It's too much pain to be living just to die</u><br>It's not worth it to endure so much suffering to only die in the end</p><br><p><u>I keep my head to the ribbon in the sky</u><br>I stay focused on my dreams and aspirations</p><br><p><u>Ribbon in the sky</u><br>Dream big</p><br><p><u>Ribbon in the sky, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa</u><br>Aim for the stars, oh, oh, oh, oh</p><br><p><span class=lyrics-text>Lyrics © Sony/ATV Music Publishing LLC, Kobalt Music Publishing Ltd.<br>Written by: Rodarius Green, Tevin Revell</span></p><p>Lyrics Licensed & Provided by <a class=ext-link href=# rel=nofollow>LyricFind</a></p>To comment on or correct specific content, <span>highlight it</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn6O2pLTIrapnm5%2BifLe1w56maIqfmayYrdWeZouhkpe8r6vIp5atoJWUoKzF</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./robbin-crosby-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Robbin Crosby Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr;
