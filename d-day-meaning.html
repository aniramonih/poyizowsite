Dwight Eisenhower, then supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Forces, some confusion continues to surround one of the few things about it that seems simple: the name.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The most widely acknowledged explanation for why that event is remembered as “D-Day” is a straightforward one. The “D” stands for “day.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It simply signifies the day that the invasion will launch and puts all the timetables into play,” says Keith Huxen, Senior Director of Research and History at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the National WWII Museum</a>. The term H-Hour worked similarly, with “H” referring to the time on D-Day when the Allied troops hit the beaches. (H-Hour was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">6:30 a.m. local time</a> for the Normandy landings.) Used in combination with minus and plus signs, the term also designated the number of hours before and after an operation’s start time.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">It’s a question people have been asking since that very week. As Stephen E. Ambrose points out in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>D-Day, June 6, 1944, The Climactic Battle of World War II</i></a>, TIME answered that question in the letters section of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">June 12, 1944, issue</a>:</p><figure class=text-left readability=37><p>Sirs:</p><p>Everybody refers to D-Day, H-Hour. Can you please tell me what they stand for or how they originated?</p><p>(NAME WITHHELD BY REQUEST) Toronto</p><p>¶ D for Day, H for Hour means the undetermined (or secret) day and hour for the start of a military operation. Their use permits the entire timetable for the operation to be scheduled in detail and its various steps prepared by subordinate commanders long before a definite day and time for the attack have been set. When the day and time are fixed, subordinates are so informed.</p><p>So far as the U.S. Army can determine, the first use of D for Day, H for Hour was in Field Order No. 8, of the First Army, A.E.F., issued on Sept. 7, 1918, which read: “The First Army will attack at H–Hour on D-Day with the object of forcing the evacuation of the St. Mihiel salient.”—ED.</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px"><a href=#>Get your history fix in one place: sign up for the weekly TIME History newsletter</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">That said, competing explanations do exist. In Paul Dickson’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>War Slang: American Fighting Words and Phrases Since the Civil War</i>,</a> the author quotes a range of alternative explanations from the <i>Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins </i>by Robert Hendrickson:</p><figure class=text-left readability=29><p>The French maintain the D means “disembarkation,” still others say “debarkation,” and the more poetic insist D-Day is short for “day of decision.” When someone wrote to General Eisenhower in 1964 asking for an explanation, his executive assistant Brigadier General Robert Schultz answered: “General Eisenhower asked me to respond to your letter. Be advised that any amphibious operation has a ‘departed date’; therefore the shortened term ‘D-Day’ is used.”</p></figure><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Of these meanings, Dickson believes one is the most rational explanation: “I think ‘disembarkation’ makes more sense because it was an amphibious assault,” he tells TIME. Amphibious assaults are operations carried out by naval ships landing troops at a hostile or potentially hostile shore. Dickson says he thinks the military was likely to have considered that “disembarkation” in deciding what to call the event because the military had a precedent of using terms that described actions.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“There was a point in 1940 when they started putting together an army and they had a first draft in anticipation of the Second World War — and that was called M-Day,” Dickson says;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> “M” stood for “mobilization.”</a> In addition, men in the U.S. between ages 21 and 35 were required to register for the draft <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">on Oct. 16, 1940</a> — which was referred to as R-Day, or “registration” day.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“R-Day for ‘registration’ day, M-Day for ‘mobilization,’ and that’s why I tend to think that D-Day stood for ‘disembarkation,’” Dickson says. “There was common military parlance, just give something a letter.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Whether “D” stood for “day,” “disembarkation” or another word, the Allied invasion of Normandy was not the only D-Day in World War II. In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">every amphibious assault</a> had its D-Day. “There were D-Days all through WWII where we performed that operation, where we landed on the beaches<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> in Morocco and in North Africa in 1942</a>, we landed on the beaches <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">in Sicily in 1943</a>,” says the National WWII Museum’s Huxen.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">So why when we say D-Day today, do we mean one particular day: June 6, 1944?</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Among those landings, Normandy’s D-Day was the one that began the end of Nazi Germany’s control. It mattered so much that it kept a name that had originally been purposefully flexible.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Had the Allied troops failed, Huxen says, “democracy would’ve been completely stamped out and crushed across continental Europe.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZubWluhXJ9jp1knZmpYrqmrc2ipaBn</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./dan-soder-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is Dan Soder Net Worth 2024: Wiki, Real Name, Age, Height, Family">&larr;
