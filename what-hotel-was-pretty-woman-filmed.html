In this article, we’ll take you on a comprehensive tour of the iconic movie’s filming locations.</p><p>If you’re short on time, here’s a quick answer: <strong>Pretty Woman was filmed in various locations around Los Angeles, California, capturing the city’s glamour and grit in equal measure. In the movie, Edward whisks Vivian away to the luxurious Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel, where they stay in a palatial suite overlooking the city.</strong></p><p>From the luxurious Beverly Wilshire Hotel to the charming streets of Hollywood, we’ll cover it all. So, let’s dive in!</p><h2>The Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel</h2><p><strong>The Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel is a luxurious five-star hotel located in the heart of Beverly Hills, California</strong>. It was originally built in 1928 and has since undergone several renovations to maintain its grandeur. The hotel has played host to many notable guests over the years, including Hollywood celebrities, politicians, and royalty.</p><p>When it comes to the film industry, the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Regent Beverly Wilshire</a> is perhaps best known for its appearance in the classic romantic comedy, Pretty Woman. The hotel served as the primary filming location for the movie, and appears prominently in several scenes.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hotelchantelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Beverly-Wilshire-Hotel.jpg alt="Beverly Wilshire Hotel" width=640 height=427 sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>The Hotel’s History</h3><p><strong>The Beverly Wilshire has a rich history that dates back nearly a century</strong>. The hotel was designed by architect Albert Martin and was originally intended to be an apartment building. However, it was later converted into a hotel due to the rise in demand for luxury accommodations in the area.</p><p>Over the years, the hotel has hosted many notable events, including the Golden Globe Awards and the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Beverly Hills International Film Festival</a>.</p><h3>The Sister Hotel</h3><p>The Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel has a sister hotel in Tokyo, Japan, called the Regent Tokyo. Both hotels are part of the Regent Hotels & Resorts chain.</p><h3>Filming Locations at the Regent Beverly Wilshire</h3><p><strong>The Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel served as the primary filming location for the iconic movie Pretty Woman</strong>. The hotel’s exterior, lobby, and rooms were all used in the film. The famous scene where Julia Roberts’ character Vivian is asked if she is “here for the weekend?” was filmed in the hotel’s lobby.</p><p>The hotel’s presidential suite was also used in the film. This suite is the most luxurious room in the hotel and is still available for guests to book today.</p><p><strong>Throughout the filming of Pretty Woman, the Beverly Wilshire served as the primary filming location for many of the movie’s most iconic scenes.</strong> Some of the most memorable include the scene where Edward (played by Richard Gere) presents Vivian (played by Julia Roberts) with a red dress to wear to the opera, as well as the scene in which Vivian sings “Kiss” in the hotel bathtub.</p><p><strong>In addition to the hotel’s interior, several exterior shots were also filmed on location at the Beverly Wilshire.</strong> These include the scene where Vivian and Edward first arrive at the hotel in a limousine and the scene where they enjoy a romantic evening on the balcony of their suite.</p><p><b>Fun Facts About the Beverly Wilshire</b></p><ul><li>The hotel’s penthouse suite, which spans over 5,000 square feet, is one of the most expensive hotel rooms in the world.</li><li>Several famous guests have stayed at the Beverly Wilshire over the years, including Elvis Presley, Barack Obama, and the Dalai Lama.</li><li>The hotel’s Italian Renaissance-style architecture was inspired by the Villa de Medici in Rome.</li><li>Many famous celebrities have stayed at the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel, including Elvis Presley, Warren Beatty, and John Lennon.</li><li>The hotel has a rooftop pool that offers stunning views of Beverly Hills and the surrounding area.</li><li>The Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel has been featured in several other movies and TV shows, including Beverly Hills Cop and Sex and the City.</li></ul><h2>Rodeo Drive</h2><p><strong>Rodeo Drive is undoubtedly one of the most famous locations in the movie Pretty Woman.</strong> This glamorous shopping street is located in the heart of Beverly Hills and is known for its high-end designer stores, luxury boutiques, and celebrity sightings.</p><p><strong>Julia Roberts’ iconic shopping spree scene was filmed on Rodeo Drive, where she famously enters a boutique and is refused service because of her appearance</strong>. This scene takes place at the intersection of Rodeo Drive and Wilshire Boulevard.</p><p>Other parts of Rodeo Drive that were featured in the movie include the Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel, where Richard Gere’s character stays, and the Beverly Hills Giorgio Armani store, where Roberts’ character goes on a shopping spree.</p><p><strong>It is worth mentioning that <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Rodeo Drive</a> is not just a movie location, but a real-life shopping destination for the rich and famous.</strong> Visitors can walk along the palm-tree-lined street and window shop at stores like Gucci, Prada, and Louis Vuitton.</p><p>If you’re a fan of the movie, keep in mind that the real-life stores on Rodeo Drive may not be as welcoming as they appear in the film. Unfortunately, not everyone gets the Pretty Woman treatment when they walk into a high-end boutique.</p><p>On the other hand, if you’re interested in the history of Rodeo Drive and its role in fashion and entertainment, there are several tours available that highlight the street’s iconic locations. The Beverly Hills Conference and Visitors Bureau offers a Rodeo Drive Walk of Style, which honors designers and style icons who have made their mark on the famous street.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hotelchantelle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Rodeo-Drive.jpg alt="Rodeo Drive" width=529 height=397 sizes="(max-width: 529px) 100vw, 529px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Hollywood Boulevard</h2><p>Hollywood Boulevard is one of the most famous streets in the world, known for its glitz, glamour, and star-studded sidewalks.
