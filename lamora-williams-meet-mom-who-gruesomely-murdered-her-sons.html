Lamora’s story is not for the faint-hearted, as it delves deep into a world where a mother’s twisted act takes center stage. The gut-wrenching scene unfolded on October 13, 2017.</p><p>The unspeakable horror that transpired that day has left so many questions unanswered. Lamora’s case got public attention as it left many reeling from shock. However, the event left many wondering how and why the tragedy occurred.</p><p>Here’s everything about the Atlanta mother who brutally murdered her children.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2023-07-07_10-55-12-fotor-2023070711642-1024x582.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Lamora_Williams></span>Who Is Lamora Williams?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lamora Williams was born to her parents in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. She grew up in a low-income household with her sister, Tabitha Hollingsworth. According to her mother, Brenda Williams, she had a troubled childhood. Lamora grew up with an undiagnosed mental issue that makes her slow while learning and doing things.&nbsp;</p><p>Lamora’s behavior raised red flags from her days as a slow learner in school, which led to homeschooling. She had a history of cutting off her sister’s dolls’ heads, cutting herself, and other disturbing acts. However, after she lost her father in 2014, her mental health struggles became more apparent, and it marked the beginning of her downward spiral.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Many_Kids_Does_Lamora_Williams_Have></span>How Many Kids Does Lamora Williams Have?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lamora was a mother of four until 2017. According to Brenda, Lamora Williams had her first child, a daughter, as a teenager. Although the romance between her and her baby daddy fizzled out prematurely, she had help raising the child. The relatives of her unidentified baby daddy provided support for the child.&nbsp;</p><p>Lamora found love again and started dating Jameel Penn Sr. Their love blossomed quickly, and their love affair produced three sons, Jameel Penn Jr., Ke’Yaunte Penn, and Ja’Karter Penn. Unfortunately, their romance died when Jameel ended the relationship in 2017. However, he kept supporting his children and their mother financially. Little did he know his life would change forever in the following months.&nbsp;</p><p>Following her break up with Jameel, Brenda immediately recognized the impending disaster. Hence, she attempted to gain custody of Lamora’s children before the tragic events unfolded. In addition, Brenda reportedly reached out to the Division of Family and Children Services to express her concerns about Lamora’s mental health and well-being. However, her worst fears materialized before she could gain custody of her grandchildren.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2023-07-07_10-55-37-fotor-2023070711445.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Did_Lamora_Williams_Do_After_Killing_Her_Sons></span>What Did Lamora Williams Do After Killing Her Sons?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Lamora Williams called her close friend, Neese Smith, on October 13, 2017. She sounded distressed, and Smith inquired what was wrong. Lamora replied to Smith and said she could no longer do it. However, she added that her sons, Ke’Yaunte and Ja’Karter, are dead. With this shocking news, Smith implored her to call the cops.&nbsp;</p><p>However, instead of calling the cops, Lamora initiated a chilling video call to her baby daddy, Jameel. During the call, she rotated the camera around the apartment and showed him the dead bodies of their sons. Immediately Jameel saw the horrifying scene, which he later described as a “real horror movie,” he called 911.&nbsp;</p><p>After her call with Jameel ended, Lamora also called 911. However, she told the dispatcher she left her three sons at the Oakland City West End apartment on Howell Place with a cousin while at work. She later changed her account and said she left her children with her sister and came home to find her kids dead.&nbsp;</p><p>While responding to the situation, emergency services discovered Ke’Yaunte and Ja’Karter with their heads inside an oven. Authorities believe that after killing the boys, Lamora Williams placed their bodies in the oven and turned it on high heat to hide the murder method.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lamora_Williams_Case></span>Lamora Williams Case<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Following the horrific event, Lamora got <a href=#>indicted</a> on four counts of felony murder, two counts of murder, two counts of aggravated assault, two counts of concealing the death of another, and one count of making false statements.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/photo_2023-07-07_10-55-53-fotor-202307071120.jpg><p>In addition, she was charged with two counts of cruelty to children in the first degree, one count of cruelty to children in the second degree, one additional count of aggravated assault, one count of obstruction of a law enforcement officer, and one count of battery resulting in substantial physical harm.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Lamora Williams’ arrest warrant, the Atlanta Police Department believed that, sometime between midnight on October 12, 2017, and 11 p.m. the next day, Lamora “knowingly and intentionally” killed her toddlers “by placing them in an oven and turning it on.” In the same event, her three-year-old son, Jameel Penn Jr., also got injured.&nbsp;</p><p>While many have wondered about the verdict on Lamora Williams’ case, there has been no further disclosure. However, online reports suggest that a judge might have seen her unfit for trial. Hence, instead of sending her to jail, she might have been sent to a psychiatric home.&nbsp;</p><p>Another case that shocked the world is <a href=#>Debra Jeter,</a> who calmly called 911 after stabbing her children. However, unlike Lamora Williams, one of Jeter’s children survived.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuaK5zquYZq%2BZobmqrcysZKadlal6rrvMZq6hp12cv7ax0qiknqSpYrq2vsOeqZ6cXZ2ys3nSqKWsZw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./landon-deru-net-worth-162619.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Landon Deru Net Worth">&larr;
