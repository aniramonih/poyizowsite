He was reorganizing his room and placing items around the house with intent to stay a while in the home he loved. He spoke of his intent to help provide for his sisters at college, and also help his mom emotionally and financially. He did not intend to end his life.”</p><p>Angus’ father, <strong>Conor Hickey</strong>, died on May 18 due to mesothelioma, a type of lung cancer. He was <a href=#>laid to rest</a> one week prior to Angus’ death.</p><p>She continued, “When we hugged goodnight we said how much we loved each other and he said he would see me in the morning. I don’t know if or what he may have put in his body after that. I only know that he put his head on the desk where he was working on art project’s, fell asleep and didn’t wake up.”</p><p>Lisa called 911 for a “possible overdose” on Monday morning in Oakland, California, after she found Angus without a pulse. Paramedics pronounced him dead on the scene.</p><p>“We may find out that he overdosed accidentally and tragically, but it’s abundantly clear that he did not intend to check out of this world,” Lisa emphasized in her Facebook post. “His struggles were real. He gave and received so much love and support to and from his tribe. His work in euphoria became a lightning rod for his generation and opened up a conversation about compassion, loyalty, acceptance and love.”</p><p>She also added that Angus was lucky to survive a head injury when he was about 15. “His head injury 10 years ago miraculously didn’t result in death as it almost always does. He was given 10 bonus years and filled them with creativity and love,” Lisa shared.</p><p>Angus’ mother asked his fans to pay tribute to the late actor in a specific way: “To honor his memory, please make random acts of kindness part of your daily life.”</p><p>The <a href=#>actor was best known</a> for his role on Euphoria as Fezco. Costar and executive producer <a href=#><strong>Zendaya</strong></a> shared a tribute to Angus on Tuesday, August 1.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Words are not enough to describe the infinite beauty that is Angus (Conor),” the Emmy winner, 26, wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a>. “I’m so grateful I got the chance to know him in this life, to call him a brother, to see his warm kind eyes and bright smile, or hear his infectious cackle of a laugh (I’m smiling now just thinking of it).”</p><p>If you or someone you know is struggling with their mental health, contact the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=noopener aria-describedby=audioeye_new_window_message>Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline</a>&nbsp;at 1-800-662-HELP (4357).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaappeqwG6vy6isnatdoryuedKasKxllaq9qbvRophmq6SWv7R5w56YraBdrK60ecCcmqKclaPBoriO</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./anya-taylor-joy-net-worth-127968.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Anya Taylor-Joy Net Worth">&larr;
