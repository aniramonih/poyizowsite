Their marriage was plagued by Rob’s habitual wife and drug addiction.</p><p><span>Diahnne endured the marriage for just over a decade before announcing it in the late 1980s. Here’s everything you need to know about the legendary actor’s first wife.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Diahnne Abbott Bio&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><span>(Age, Race, and Other Background Information)</span></strong></h2><p><span>The former Madame De Niro was born Diahnne Eugenia Abbott on January 1, 1945 in New York, United States.&nbsp;Very little is known about Abbott’s upbringing or the family she grew up in, but it is a well-known fact that she is the cousin of 80s hit musician Gregory Abbott.</span></p><p><span>They have the same last name which means Diahnee and Gregory are paternal cousins.&nbsp;Diahnne’s breed can be traced to the island of Antigua where her father is from.&nbsp;Details of his mother’s origin are unknown, but his cousin Gregory’s mother was from Venezuela.</span></p><p><span>Artistic genes seem to flow through the Abbott family.&nbsp;Diahnne’s cousin, Gregory, is not only a singer, but also a composer and producer.&nbsp;In the mid-1980s, he hit it big with his song&nbsp;</span><span>Shake You</span><span>, which was certified platinum by the RIAA.&nbsp;Greg continues to record music to this day.</span></p><p><span>Abbott was unknown to the general public until she got attached to her longtime boyfriend, Robert De Niro.&nbsp;Her acting career reportedly officially began in 1976, the year she married Robert.&nbsp;Abbott made his debut in Robert’s 1976 film&nbsp;</span><span>Taxi Driver</span><span>&nbsp;as directed by Martin Scorsese.&nbsp;Set in post-Vietnam War New York, Abbott starred as a concession girl in the film.</span></p><p><span>Also in 1976, Abbé appeared in&nbsp;</span><span>Welcome to LA.;&nbsp;</span><span>the film that won actress Geraldine Chaplin the British Academy Film BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actress.&nbsp;Abbott’s next two films also starred her husband Robert.</span></p><p><span>They include musical drama films&nbsp;</span><span>New York, New York</span><span>&nbsp;(1977) where she portrayed a Harlem Club singer and sang Fats Waller’s classic song&nbsp;</span><span>Rose of Honeysuckle</span><span>, as well as&nbsp;</span><span>The King of Comedy</span><span>&nbsp;(1983) a satirical film black comedy in which she plays the character of Rita Keane the love interest of De Niro’s character.&nbsp;Both films were directed by Robert’s friend Martin Scorsese.</span></p><p><span>Diahnne Abbott’s next film would include&nbsp;</span><span>Love Streams</span><span>&nbsp;(1984),&nbsp;</span><span>Jo Jo Dancer</span><span>,&nbsp;</span><span>Your Life Is Calling</span><span>&nbsp;(1986),&nbsp;</span><span>Before Night Falls</span><span>&nbsp;(2000), and&nbsp;</span><span>Soliloquy</span><span>&nbsp;(2002).&nbsp;In 1988, she appeared in three episodes of the NBC crime drama series&nbsp;</span><span>A Crime Story</span></p><h2><strong><span>Her ex-husband Robert De Niro and her children</span></strong></h2><p><span>Abbott began dating Robert De Niro in the 1970s, and after a long-term relationship, they married in 1976.
