They are both late now.&nbsp;She is the only child they ever had and is the last child Taylor ever gave birth to. Liza was primarily raised by her mother and never knew the loving touch of her father.&nbsp;</p><p>This is because Mike Todd died in a plane crash on March 22, 1958. Despite his absence, Liza has grown to become a wonderful adult.&nbsp;Unfortunately, not many people know what she does or how she lives because of how private she is.</p><p>Keep reading to learn more about her.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lizzz.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Liza_Todds_Birth></span>Liza Todd’s Birth<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Mike Todd died before Liza got to know him as a father. However, he met her before he passed.&nbsp;Liza was born on August 6, 1957, and the delivery was difficult. Taylor had to endure a problematic premature labor before she eventually gave birth to Liza via cesarean section.&nbsp;</p><p>The ordeal shook Mike, and after the whole affair, he had the doctors sterilize Taylor, essentially making Liza the last child she would ever carry.&nbsp;Liza Todd never knew her father, but that does not mean she grew up without a man playing his role in her life.&nbsp;</p><p>She has had up to four stepdads, including pop singer Eddie Fisher, movie actor Richard Burton, U.S. Senator John Warner, and Larry Fortensky.&nbsp;Among them, the man she considers her “real” father, thanks to their closeness, was her second stepdad, Richard Burton, who adopted her.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Liza_Todds_Life_Now></span>Liza Todd’s Life Now<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Since she was born into fame, Liza Todd was exposed to the spotlight very early in life. As a child, she was often seen publicly, so many believed she would follow her mother’s path into showbiz.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Liza had other plans — none that had anything to do with the fame and publicity she was born into. Instead, she lived privately while supporting her mom from the shadows.&nbsp;</p><p>Her childhood experience with the paparazzi birthed her aversion to the spotlight. According to a source, nowhere was safe from the cameras, including their home.&nbsp;</p><p>The source said: “I remember once we were permitted to use the garden hose on the telephoto lenses peering over the wall.”&nbsp;Liza also had many guards following her around for her safety because her mother was very protective of her identity.&nbsp;</p><p>That made Liza grow up with a disdain for publicity and an affinity for privacy, which she pursued as she got older.&nbsp;These days, Liza <a href=#>lives</a> a peaceful life surrounded by animals in a quiet town near Hudson, New York.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/lizz.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Liza_Todd_Siblings></span>Liza Todd Siblings<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The elusive woman has four siblings in total. She has two half-brothers: Michael Wilding Jr. and Christopher Edward Wilding.&nbsp;</p><p>She also has a stepsister named Kate Burton. Their father, Richard Burton, also adopted a German orphan, Maria Burton Carson, bringing her siblings up to four.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Liza_Todd_Career></span>Liza Todd Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>She graduated from Hornsey College of Art in London and went to the Otis Institute in Los Angeles to further her learning.&nbsp;After completing her education in 1979, Liza started her professional journey as a sculptor. Her love for horses influenced her to choose a creative career, which explains her fanaticism for equestrian bronze sculptures.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Liza_Todds_Husband></span>Who Is Liza Todd’s Husband?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Liza has only been married once. She tied the knot with Hap Tivey in 1984 and lived happily with him in a retro farmhouse in Manhattan (now sold) for two decades.&nbsp;</p><p>They officially divorced in 2003, and Liza has never married another man. She and Tivey welcomed two sons, Quinn Tivey and Rhys Tivey.&nbsp;Unlike her, the boys are involved in showbiz, but Liza does not mind since it is their passion.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/iza.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Liza_Todds_Relationship_With_Elizabeth_Taylor></span>Liza Todd’s Relationship With Elizabeth Taylor<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>While Liza is not a big fan of being an actress, she loved working on projects with her mother.&nbsp;Her representative Jeanne Chisholm said: “Liza doesn’t have a persecution complex about being Elizabeth Taylor’s daughter… She thoroughly enjoyed doing projects with her mother.”&nbsp;</p><p>One of the projects Liza and her mom have worked together on include a jewelry line. The projects were a way for mother and daughter to spend time together, and they cherished it.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=#>Elizabeth Taylor </a>is late now, but Liza has all the memories from the projects they embarked on together.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuarGwGarqJyUYsCpsYyiqmannpp6sLKMnqOispGXsrW0jK2YsqSfp8Buss6uqWajmZnAcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./malcolm-x.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Malcolm X">&larr;
