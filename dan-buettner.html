The key to success involved focusing on the ecology of health&nbsp;– creating a healthy environment rather than relying on individual behaviors.</p><p>In 2006, under aegis of National Geographic, Buettner collaborated with Poulain and Costa Rican demographer Dr. Luis Rosero-Bixby to identify a fourth longevity hotspot in the Nicoya Peninsula.

Soon thereafter he went to work for Washington Post columnist Remar Sutton and Paris Review Editor <a href=#>George Plimpton</a> to organize the National Public Radio’s Celebrity Croquet Tournament. The three men formed a lifelong friendship. Buettner recalls, "George was heavily influenced by the notion that you can do what you love and make a living out of it. If you’re good at universalizing your experiences in an artful way, you can pretty much do what you want to do."</p><p>Dan Buettner (born June 18, 1960) is an American National Geographic Fellow and New York Times-bestselling author.
