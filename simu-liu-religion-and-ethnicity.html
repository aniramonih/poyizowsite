The actor celebrates his birthday on April 20th of each year, which falls under the astrological sign of Taurus.</p><p style=text-align:justify>A graduate with honors of the Ivey Business School at Western University, Simu worked as an accountant at Deloitte before entering the entertainment sector. However, in April 2012, she was let go from her position there.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.current-affairs.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Simu-Liu-300x226.jpg><h2 id=is-simu-liu-koreannbspnationality-and-origin-explored><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Simu_Liu_Korean_Nationality_And_Origin_Explored></span>Is Simu Liu Korean?&nbsp;Nationality And Origin Explored<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p style=text-align:justify>However, Liu is neither Korean nor was he born in Korea, despite the fact that he is frequently mistaken for a Korean male. The actor is of Asian descent, yet neither south nor north Korea can lay claim to his citizenship.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Instead, he is of Chinese descent, having been born and brought up in China by his cherished grandparents. He will forever be grateful to them for the love they poured upon him throughout his youth. On the other hand, he is a fan of Korean barbecue and hotpots, and he adores coming to Koreatown and spending quality time with a large group of people while dining.</p><p style=text-align:justify>He was born in Harbin, Heilongjiang, China, and was nurtured by his grandparents from the time he was a toddler until he reached five, at which point he migrated to another side of the world. Simu now resides in Canada, however he is originally from China.</p><p style=text-align:justify>One day, the actor’s father showed up at his door to take him back, and they emigrated to Kingston, Ontario, Canada, where his parents were pursuing graduate school. The city is located in Ontario, Canada. After some time, they relocated to Etobicoke and remained there until they purchased a home in Mississauga, Ontario. In addition, both of Liu’s parents are still based in Mississauga, but Liu has an apartment in the heart of Toronto’s financial district that he rarely uses because of his travel schedule.</p><h2 id=what-religion-and-ethnicity-does-simu-liu-follows><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Religion_And_Ethnicity_Does_Simu_Liu_Follows></span>What Religion And Ethnicity Does Simu Liu Follows?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p style=text-align:justify>Liu is of Asian descent and Canadian citizenship, although he has not yet shared his religious beliefs with the public. On the other hand, a number of websites on the internet have claimed that the actor is a Buddhist.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Following in the footsteps of Gautama Buddha makes perfect sense for Simu given that he was born and reared in China up until the age of five, and that he possesses Chinese roots and culture. On the other hand, he hasn’t disclosed a great deal about his beliefs and the people he follows on his social networking sites.</p><h2 id=simu-liu-family-meet-the-actors-father-and-mother><span class=ez-toc-section id=Simu_Liu_Family_Meet_The_Actor%E2%80%99s_Father_And_Mother></span>Simu Liu Family: Meet The Actor’s Father And Mother<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p style=text-align:justify>The parents of Simu, Zhenning Liu and Zheng Liu, uprooted their family and moved to another country so that they could pursue their doctoral studies. During this time, they were forced to leave their little boy in the care of his grandparents. Simu is their son.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Although he was close to his maternal grandparents and spent every night cuddling with them, he found it difficult to coexist with his parents because of the high standards of perfection they had for him and the cultural disparities between their families.</p><p style=text-align:justify>The actor rebelled against his parents by starting a boy band, going to late-night parties, flirting with females, and getting grades in the B range. He believed that he had the worst parents, and their relationship got worse as he pursued a career in acting.</p><p style=text-align:justify>However, they were able to mend and simplify their tangled bond over time by confronting each other. Liu expressed all of his feelings in an eight-page letter that he handed Zheng on the occasion of his 60th birthday, and ever since then, the mother and son have been the best of friends.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pMHRq5ynrF2Ws6etyKuqZ6einHy0tcyuZKWhpWK%2FprjIoKCopl2Wu6V5xK2fp6GTnsG6ew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./title-jake-paul-says-hes-got-60m-for-a-kanye-west-pete-davidson-boxing-match.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jake Paul Offers $60M For Kanye West &amp;amp; Pete Davidson Boxing Match">&larr;
