However, only having her ears pierced at 21 shows this superstar makes her own rules.</p><p class=Eg>When asked about her most high-profile relationship to date with a former British boy band member, Hailee Steinfeld wished only to share the details when she is comfortable as she is a very private person. She appears to have given some insight into this romance with her track "Wrong Direction."</p><p class=Eg>The "Dickinson" actress is a Sagittarius and lives up to her star sign's stereotypical quality of spontaneity, especially since the lockdown. She tries not to overthink life anymore and goes for what she wants, which is unfortunately not what her fans want -- PDA with a boyfriend.</p><p><h2 class=Ig><strong class=Cg>Hailee Steinfeld's First Kiss Was on Screen</strong></h2></p><p class=Eg>Like fellow child actor <a class="Sd a" href=#>Mila Kunis</a>, Steinfeld had her first kiss with a boy <a class="Sd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.nickiswift.com/713988/things-you-didnt-know-about-hailee-steinfeld/>on camera</a>. Unlike Kunis, who went on to marry her first kiss, Ashton Kutcher, hers was less memorable. Around 11 or 12, the star estimated, she was in a student film that called for smooches with two boys.</p><p class=Eg>One of the actors needed an apple box to reach her lips, while the other told her he was pretending to be kissing his mother. The actress remembers the situation as "very awkward" and does not consider it her proper first kiss.</p><p class=Eg>She experienced the real deal before entering the sixth grade at her front door. The encounter did not meet her admittedly high expectations, and she was reminded of it every time she walked through the door.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/2d6b23a33ba6282bd37b16cbaa5bb2ba.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Actress Hailee Steinfeld and Cameron Smoller attend W Magazine Celebrates the Best Performances Portfolio and the Golden Globes at Chateau Marmont on January 5, 2017 in Los Angeles, California. | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=Ig><strong class=Cg>Cameron Smoller and Hailee Steinfeld's Rumored Sweethearts</strong></h2></p><p class=Eg>The pair are said to have started dating in 2016 and attended industry events like the Golden Globes in the early months of 2017.

Both these rumored flings have been discredited as platonic friendships.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/a471782e782c285897e2fe5da2423853.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Hailee Steinfeld and Niall Horan during the 2017 American Music Awards at Microsoft Theater on November 19, 2017 in Los Angeles, California. | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=Ig><strong class=Cg>Hailee Steinfeld's Relationship with Niall Horan Went in the Wrong Direction</strong></h2></p><p class=Eg>The year 2018 was peppered with the sightings of Steinfeld and former One Direction member Niall Horan.

That same month, the actress told a magazine that she appreciated fans' interest in her life, <a class="Sd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/niall-horans-dating-history-demi-lovato-hailee-steinfeld-more/>adding</a>:</p><p class=Eg>"… but I think that sometimes it's hard for people to realize that there are boundaries to a person's life and personal life."</p><p class=Eg>By August 16, 2018, the young lovers seemed more comfortable sharing their love and were snapped making out by the paparazzi while running errands around Los Angeles. They also <a class="Sd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.j-14.com/posts/hailee-steinfeld-boyfriend-150030/>hang out </a>at Disneyland, where the actress blew him kisses on one of the rides.</p><p class=Eg>A source close to the pair revealed in December 2018 that the relationship had fizzled out due to Steinfeld's busy schedule, but <a class="Sd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/niall-horans-dating-history-demi-lovato-hailee-steinfeld-more/>claimed</a>, "They still have a lot of love for each other."</p><p class=Eg>The singer-songwriter did not address the breakup directly but left her fans clear clues about her state of mind. In January 2019, she reposted a story by singer Julia Michaels, "New Year's Resolution: no more dating narcissists," and co-signed it <a class="Sd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.j-14.com/posts/hailee-steinfeld-boyfriend-150030/>saying,</a> "preach."</p><p class=Eg>In her breakup anthem released in May 2020, "Wrong Direction," she <a class="Sd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncV1TlNl9B8&ab_channel=HaileeSteinfeldVEVO">sings</a>: "Baby, I can't keep/ Fallin' in the wrong direction/ How did you sweep me right off my feet?"
