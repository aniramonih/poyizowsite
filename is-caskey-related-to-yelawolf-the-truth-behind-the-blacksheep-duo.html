But are they related by blood or family? The answer is no. They are simply friends and musical partners who share a similar vision and passion for rap. However, they do consider each other as brothers in spirit, as they have formed a strong bond over their common experiences, values and goals.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>How Caskey and Yelawolf Met and Became Friends</h3><p>Caskey (formerly of Cash Money Records) and Yelawolf (formerly of Shady Records) first met in 2019, when they featured on each other’s songs, “No Such Thing as Free” and “Remember”. They instantly clicked and realized they had a lot in common, such as their love for tattoos, motorcycles, and southern culture. They also respected each other’s skills and styles, as they both blended different genres of music, such as rock, country, and metal, into their rap.</p><p>The two rappers decided to work together more and create an album’s worth of material. They locked in at Yelawolf’s studio in Nashville, Tennessee, and recorded over 20 songs in a span of two weeks. They also shot several music videos, such as “Been a Problem” and “Billy and the Purple Datsun”, showcasing their chemistry and charisma. The result was the album Yelawolf Blacksheep, which was released on February 19, 2021, and featured guest appearances from DJ Paul of Three 6 Mafia and Cub da CookUpBoss.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Why Caskey and Yelawolf Call Themselves Blacksheep</h3><p>Caskey and Yelawolf chose the name Blacksheep for their album and their duo, because they felt it represented their identity and attitude. They explained that they have always been outsiders and rebels in the rap industry, as they did not fit into any conventional box or category. They also faced a lot of criticism and backlash from some fans and critics, who accused them of being sellouts, traitors, or culture vultures, because of their affiliation with mainstream labels or their incorporation of other musical influences.</p><p>However, Caskey and Yelawolf did not let the negativity affect them. Instead, they embraced their uniqueness and diversity, and used it as a source of strength and inspiration. They also expressed their loyalty and gratitude to their true fans, who supported them throughout their careers and appreciated their artistic vision. They said that being a blacksheep means being different, but also being proud and confident of who you are and what you do.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What Caskey and Yelawolf Plan to Do Next</h3><p>Caskey and Yelawolf have stated that they are not done making music together, and that they have more songs and projects in the works. They also hinted that they might go on a tour together, once the COVID-19 pandemic is over and the live music scene is back to normal. They said that they are excited to perform their songs live and connect with their fans in person</p><p>Caskey and Yelawolf are two talented and versatile rappers, who have proven their skills and creativity in the rap game. They are also good friends and brothers, who have supported and inspired each other. They are not related by blood or family, but they are related by rap and spirit. They are the Blacksheep duo, and they are here to stay.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfnsBur8Csop6xXaeyra3TnptmrJ9ixqa4wLCmpZ5dqbWmedOrrK2gXZeyqbXNnWStoJVir62twqSqoZ2VpXqlwc5o</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-puppy-from-love-after-lockup-in-jail.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is puppy from Love After Lockup in jail?">&larr;
