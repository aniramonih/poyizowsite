She always dreamt of being in front of the camera and circulate news to the huge mass. Today we are getting inside the biography of influential Thompson.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Mary Thompson is an American journalist who formerly worked as a reporter for CNBC. Currently she serves as the managing director at G100 Companies.</i></p><h2>Early life & Bio&nbsp;</h2><p>American born Thompson was very keen when it comes to journalism from a very young age. The star who loved keeping others live up to date has always kept her personal life away from the media.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/18/Capture%20(1)-1568788450544.jpg><p>Former CNBC reporter has a sister other than that; there is no information about her parents. Two years back, she had posted a picture where she wished her sister a Happy birthday with the picture. She captioned the picture,&nbsp;</p><p>Happy Birthday to my sister @<strong>annenbcnews</strong>. Here we are celebrating 10 years ago. Can't wait to celebrate the next ten!</p><p>The most interesting fact is her sister, Anne Thompson is also engaged in the journalism field. Anne works for NBC News as Chief Environmental Affairs correspondent</p><h2>Academic Achievements</h2><p>Moving back to her early life, she joined the University of Notre Dame to complete her studies with B.A. degree in English. Later, she had a change of her mind and attended Columbia University to study journalism. Thompson graduated from the college in 1991 with a degree in journalism.</p><p>Way before laying her hands in the field of journalism, Mary worked as a Salesperson in Fidelity Investments. For more than four years she served in the given sector from 1986 to 1990. &nbsp;</p><h2>Beginning of the flourishing career</h2><p>After graduation, Mary started off her job as a reporter in Bloomberg TV & Radio until 2000. As per her linked in an account she was the second person on Bloomberg TV. Serving in Bloomberg as a reporter gained Thompson a huge deal of experience and qualification.&nbsp;</p><h3>16 years of experience in CNBC</h3><p>Then to explore her experience, she moved to CNBC as a general assignment reporter. In CNBC she worked for more than 16 years.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2019/9/18/Capture%20(2)-1568788543650.jpg><p>There Mary backed up reporters at the New York Stock Exchange, the NYMEX, the Nasdaq and covered a number of economic stories as well. While working in CNBC, Mary has also worked with <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Melissa Lee</strong></a> and <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Scott Mcgrew</strong></a>, high profile news journalist.&nbsp;</p><h3>Change of Career Pathway</h3><p>After serving in the reporting field for more than 25 years, she decided to change her career pathway in 2016.&nbsp;</p><p>She began to work at G100 Network as a Managing Director. As per her Linkedin account, G100 Companies provide executive and board development for Fortune 1000 companies through peer learning environments.&nbsp;</p><h3>Awards & Nominations</h3><p>For breaking news coverage of the Bernard Madoff scandal, Thompson received a Gerald Loeb Award for Distinguished Business and Financial Journalism in 2010. In 2005, for her reporting on price-fixing in the insurance industry, she got a National Headliner Award.</p><h3>Volunteer Experience&nbsp;</h3><p>Along with her sky-rocketing career, Thompson also has served voluntarily. Since 2012, she has been serving as a Member of the Board of Directors of College of St. Benedict.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, she is also the part of the non-profitable organization, YMCA of Greater New York. The organization is working to empower youth, improve health, and strengthen a community.&nbsp;</p><h2>Current Relationship Status</h2><p>As mentioned above, Mary is very low-key when it comes to her personal life. Thompson has never been spotted with any male figure other than her co-worker. She has given her whole and sole to her professional life.&nbsp;</p><p>Mary is an active user of the Twitter. However, she only tweets related to her work and family in her account. Thompson could be living a single life, but the probability is very thin due to her evolving age.&nbsp;</p><h2>Net Worth&nbsp;</h2><p>Having an experience of 25 years solely in the journalism field is nowhere near to a joke, so, for sure, her net worth is in millions of figure. The 1.71 m tall reporter, Mary's is assumed to be worth $1 million.</p><h3>Salary&nbsp;</h3><p>As per the glass door, the average salary of CNBC is <strong>$74,262</strong>. Nevertheless, having decades of experience in the reporting sector, she surely had <strong>$100,00 </strong>monthly. As for now, she has moved from reporting to work as a Managing Director, so her earning is definitely huge.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>To get access to more Journalist biography visit- </strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"><strong>Marriedceleb</strong></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jqaYq7FdqbWwuc%2Bspqc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./grain-valley-shooting-today.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Grain Valley Shooting Today | In loving Memories News">&larr;
