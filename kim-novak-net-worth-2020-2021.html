Well, if you’re ready, let’s start.</p><h2>Early Life & Biography</h2><p>Kim Novak, born Marylin Pauline Novak, was born in Chicago, Illinois, to parents Joseph and Blanche Novak. Both her parents were original Czech descendants. Joseph, her father, was a history teacher who also took a job as a freight dispatcher at the Chicago Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad. As for her mother, she worked at a factory. Kim attended William Penn Elementary and later went on to join Farragut High School.</p><p>Later on, after her high school life, she went ahead and joined Wright Junior College, where her hard work and talent helped her to bag herself two scholarships at the School of Art Institute of Chicago. During the summer break in her last semester in junior college, Kim went on a cross country tour for a refrigeration company at trade shows.</p><h2>Personal Life</h2><p>Kim was first married to English actor Richard Johnson with whom they divorced a year later but still maintained their friendship. She was later engaged to director Richard Quine but never got to do a wedding. She also dated numerous people, including the adopted son of the Dominican Dictator Rafael Trujillo. Kim moved to Big Sur in the 60s in order to pursue her passion for painting and raising horses. &nbsp;It was in 1974 that she met her current husband, Richard Quine, who they got married in 1976.</p><h2>Age, Height, and Weight</h2><p>Being born on 13 February 1933, Kim Novak is 91 years old as of today’s date 20th July 2024. Her height is 1.6m tall, and her weight is 56 kg.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Kim’s long acting career began after she was cast as extras for the movies The French Line and Son of Sinbad. It was while she was at Los Angeles where she was discovered by an agent who signed to a contract with Colombia Pictures. At the onset of her career, she was engaged in a battle with Colombia’s chief over the changing of her name to “Kit Marlowe,” but she insisted that her Polish and Czech ancestry were an essential part of her heritage. Therefore, they settled for the name “Kim Novak” instead of as a compromise.</p><p>Kim’s first role was in the film Pushover and the romantic comedy &nbsp;The French Line in 1954. Both films were a major success in the Box Office. In 1955 Kim took on the role of Madge Owens in the hit film Picnic, which turned out to be a huge box Office triumph for her and for Colombia Pictures.</p><p>Kim appeared in very many successful movies and was considered as one of the greatest hits of the 1950s.

Later on, her career experienced major setbacks after most of her films proved not to be very successful.</p><p>In 1964 she played a leading role in the movie Kiss Me Stupid, which made no impact on her career. She also was the lead female in the Eye of The Devil alongside David Niven; during the filming of the movie, she fell off a horse and suffered injuries that took time to heal. She later gave up the role.</p><p>By the end of the 60s, she started to act less and decided to focus on visual arts and poetry, and she even moved away from Hollywood. In 1980 she appeared in the British mystery thriller The Mirror Crack’d, which was a moderate success, she did not appear in any other film for the whole of that decade.
