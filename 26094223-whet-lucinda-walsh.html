The tension between Zimmer and Forbes and their characters was palatable. You really never knew where they were going with it.

Did Marland have a similar story planned for GL that maybe Long found and went with? It always struck me as strange they would go there when Bradley/Beth was so high profile.</p><p>One of the things you can tell when you are able to look a writer's career from beginning to end is patterns. I think most of the better soap writers have 3 or 4 what I call "back pocket" or "go to" storylines that they just repurpose for different characters and, if they are soap hoppers, different shows. Name a soap writer and you can probably name at least 3 or 4 stories that they are constantly retelling. A few things may change here and there, but at the core its' the exact same story. "Incest" and sexual abuse was a well that Marland kept going back to, for obvious reasons. It's filled with dramatic potential.</p><p>I always like to point to Bill Bell as someone who just wrote and rewrote the same five basic stories on Days, Y&R and B&B. And this is probably why the good/great soap writers are so good. They know what works and how to tweak it enough to make it seem somewhat fresh when grafted on to new characters.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 73</td><td class=timestamp><span>May 9, 2020 3:10 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>I sincerely doubt that Doug Marland left much of a story bible when he departed GL. Remember, he left in a huff. The show was such a mess between his departure in Sept. 1982 and Pam Long's arrival in May 1983, I sincerely doubt any of the HWs in those 8 months (and there were several different HWs, including Pat Falken Smith) were working off any kind of long-term story outline that Marland left.</p><p>I think the Beth storyline was all Pam Long. And she did recycle that storyline albeit slightly modified with the character of BJ Walker (played by Sydney Penny) during her year-long tenure on Santa Barbara in 1992 before it was canceled.</p><p>As for Marland, he told an incest storyline on Loving in 1983-84 with the character of Lilly Slater (played by Jennifer Ashe) who was being molested by her father Garth Slater.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 74</td><td class=timestamp><span>May 9, 2020 3:42 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>Opps, hit Post before I finished my idea.</p><p>The Loving incest storyline gave Marland practice for telling the incest story on ATWT. You see, the Loving storyline was aborted by order of ABC top brass. ABC planned to air a prime-time movie called Something About Amelia starring Glenn Close and Ted Danson in Jan 1984. That movie dealth with a father molesting his daughter.</p><p>ABC wanted to promote the movie as a groundbreaking television first to deal with incest. Thus, the Loving story was shutdown quickly and swept under the carpet. The Lilly character never really dealt with the long term consequences of being molested by her father.</p><p>So, on ATWT, Marland had more time to develop the storyline and also deal with the consequences.</p><table class="info small"><tr><td class=by>by <span>Anonymous</span></td><td class=count>reply 75</td><td class=timestamp><span>May 9, 2020 3:50 PM</span></td></tr></table><p>In case anyone is interested, there's a new DL thread about the movie Something About Amelia.

The house the truck was carrying fell off the truck and landed in the sideyard of the boarding house.

By his 2nd and 3rd stints, Bradley was redeemed. But Rebhorn played evil so well. He should have been nominated for the Beth story.

Of course you are welcome to visit it if you like, but I wanted to share this particular post, as it has some tidbits on it from someone who is claiming to know Billy.</p><p>**************** It was a long time ago but from what I remember is he would pretend to like a person and try to get close to them to get them to stage fan events for him, get people to hang outside the studio to treat him like he was the biggest star around. Most of those who came for a few bucks didn't have any idea who he was. He said for them to act like teen girls acted when they saw the Beatles, you know scream and rush to him and beg for autographs, shit like that. Those were some of the milder things. He was said to be a real shit to other actors and crew, not at first but he quickly thought he was god's gift to acting, he was not liked. Add in that it was said he would fuck anyone, male or female if he thought could help his career but that is probably typical of many people, fucking to get ahead in their chosen career. Once he got what he could from someone he would cut them dead, I guess what they now call ghosting. There might have been some other little things but those bigger ones is what I remember. He was not liked, that much I remember.</p><p>Keep in mind he was, at that time, an actor on a soap, taped in Brooklyn. He acted like he was huge star. That alone probably pissed off people.</p><p>The only other interesting thing I remember from that time is that the actor Roger Howarth had a hot raging affair with some actress on the show and got them to break up another popular paring he was having at the time to make this actress' character his love interest on the show and she was a sucky actress by all reports. She also would walk around the set naked. Nothing interesting was said about anyone else on the show other than some actor, I can't remember his name either, was a religious right nut and pissed off everyone trying to convert them.

Because it was strictly actresses on the reunion I think they felt comfortable discussing their shared experiences w/ Joe Stuart. No one mentioned Agnes Nixon or Doug Marland -- was all about Stuart.</p><p>Susan Walters spoke out first — she set the tone. Ms. Walters said she was young, in her first job and Stuart bullied her relentlessly. She was the lowest paid of the cast but among the more popular characters. When her contract came up, she asked for a raise to bring her in line w/ her costars— TPTB came back w/ an insulting $40 per week increase, so she left.</p><p>When hiring Noelle Beck, TPTB wanted her to get a nose job ON CAMERA so they could write her plastic surgery into the show. Shocked that Nixon and Marland would even consider such a thing. Beck refused, was hired anyway and pointed out that today she still has her original nose.</p><p>Sfter coming back from maternity leave, Lauren Marie said Joe asked her: when are “we” going to lose the baby weight ?</p><p>Elizabeth Burr and Patty Lotz had stories about auditioning for Stuart. Tudor said she escaped Stuart’s misogyny after standing up to him in her audition when she didn’t know he was the producer .</p><p>Jennifer Ashe is to this day still upset that her incest storyline was wrapped up so abruptly.
