In addition, he is currently working as a managing partner of Crescent Capital Group.</p><p>Attanasio has gained recognition for becoming the owner of one of the famous baseball teams. Hence, he usually appears in the limelight. Looking at his fame, one can assume that many might want to know about his personal life, including his family members.</p><p>So, let us get to know more about Mark Attanasio’s wife, <strong>Debbie Attanasio</strong>, from this article.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Happily_Married_For_Many_Years></span>Happily Married For Many Years<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The well-known businessman is married to <strong>Deborah Kaplan</strong>, also known as Debbie Attanasio, and ever since, the lovely couple has been living a blissful life in Brentwood. In addition, the pair also <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">own another home</a>, worth more than $6.5 million, in Malibu’s exclusive Broad Beach area.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Mark-Attanasio-and-his-wife.jpg><p>Moreover, Mark Attanasio’s spouse is often seen attending various events with her husband. Being the spouse of such a successful businessman, Deborah must be living a very luxurious life with her spouse.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Mark_Attanasios_Wife_Is_A_Proud_Mother_Of_Two_Sons></span>Mark Attanasio’s Wife Is A Proud Mother Of Two Sons<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Talking about Deborah and Mark Attanasio’s children, they have two handsome sons, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Mike Attanasio</strong></a> and <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Dan Attanasio</strong></a>. Unlike his dad, Dan is involved in the entertainment industry as he used to be a member of the rock band Pan Am.</p><p>However, Mark’s youngest son, Mike, followed his father’s footsteps and has made a pretty good impact in the business world. Although Dan and Mike are very secretive, being the grandson of a famous actor and the son of a successful businessman, they have got fame since the beginning.</p><p>Deborah Attanasio must be proud of both of her kids’ achievements.</p><p><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Bud Black’s wife, Nanette Steffen</strong></a></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Prefers_To_Keep_A_Low_Profile></span>Prefers To Keep A Low Profile<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Ever since Mark purchased the Milwaukee Brewers, he has become a well-known personality in MLB. He has been in the news and appears in several social events on multiple occasions.</p><p>However, unlike her husband, Mark Attanasio’s wife does not often come in front of the limelight. Nonetheless, she is always there to support her life partner during significant events.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/ecelebritymirror.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Deborah-Attanasio-is-very-secretive.jpg><p>Even though Debbie has been keeping her personal life very private, she once <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">accompanied her hubby</a> in a program, Inside The Brewers, at the Rubenstein Pavilion on Prospect Avenue. The Jewish Museum Milwaukee presented this event with their special exhibit Chasing Dreams: Baseball & Becoming American.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Actively_Involved_In_Philanthropic_Works></span>Actively Involved In Philanthropic Works<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Just like many other baseball team owners, both Mark and his wife actively participate in charitable works. More specifically, Deborah has participated in many charity events through Brewers Community Foundation. Additionally, the adorable duo has also gifted $1 million to the Brewers Community Foundation in the memory of Debbie’s parents.</p><p>Furthermore, both Mark and Deborah are involved in many charities in their hometown of Los Angeles and the Milwaukee area. Some of the local charities that the Attanasios have supported include the Children’s Outing Association of Milwaukee, the United Way of Milwaukee, and the Greater Milwaukee Committee.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_A_Baseball_Fan></span>Is A Baseball Fan<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In an interview, Mark had said that his family, especially his wife, had supported in the most when he decided to buy Brewers. He stated that Debbie was also a die-hard fan of the New York Yankees, just like himself. But when he decided to purchase the Milwaukee Brewers, she was by his side.</p><p>Let’s hear from Mark himself about how he found out that his wife is a huge baseball fan during the initial stage of their relationship.</p><p>Furthermore, he <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">even shared how</a> Mark quizzed Debbie about the Yankees during one of the first dates, much like the hopeful bride was grilled on the history of the Baltimore Colts in the movie “Diner. When she answered all of his questions, that was the moment Mark knew that she was the one for him.</p><p>In addition, Mark and Debbie, sometimes joined by their sons, watch the baseball games together in their home.</p><p>We hope to see Mark Attanasio’s wife with her husband more often in public. Additionally, we wish the adorable pair a happy married life in the upcoming days too.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidk5q5pq7RoquypZmnv7C%2BjZympmeVo8GmvtOaoKellaPBcLnAq6JmmaSprq%2Bt0qKmZq%2BZm7JusMSbpquZmGQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./wiki-biography-net-worth-age-career-relationship-family-952-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Galey Alix Wiki, Biography, Net Worth, Age, Career, Relationship,Family">&larr;
