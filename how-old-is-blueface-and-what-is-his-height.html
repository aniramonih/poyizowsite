He is definitely one of the tallest rappers in the industry.</strong></p><p>Asides from his considerable height, Blueface has been able to build up his career in the rap industry. After the release of the music video for his song “Respect My Cryppin” in 2018, he went viral due to his peculiar style of rapping which has been described as offbeat. After his unprecedented success on social media, he got signed by the West Coast branch of Birdman’s Cash Money Records label – Money West. His debut studio album – Find the Beat, was released in 2020.</p><p class=ez-toc-title>Table of Contents</p><span class=ez-toc-title-toggle><a href=# class="ez-toc-pull-right ez-toc-btn ez-toc-btn-xs ez-toc-btn-default ez-toc-toggle" aria-label="Toggle Table of Content" role=button><span><span class=ez-toc-icon-toggle-span></span></span></a></span><ul class="ez-toc-list ez-toc-list-level-1 eztoc-toggle-hide-by-default"><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-1" href=# title="Summary of Blueface’s Biography">Summary of Blueface’s Biography</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-2" href=# title="How Tall is Blueface Now?">How Tall is Blueface Now?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-3" href=# title="Blueface’s Height Places Him Above The Average American Man and Most Male Rappers">Blueface’s Height Places Him Above The Average American Man and Most Male Rappers</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-4" href=# title="Blueface’s Height Compared to DDG">Blueface’s Height Compared to DDG</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-5" href=# title="Blueface’s Height Compared to Dababy">Blueface’s Height Compared to Dababy</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-6" href=# title="Is Blueface Taller than Lil Mosey?">Is Blueface Taller than Lil Mosey?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-7" href=# title="How Tall is Blueface Compared To Yung Gravy?">How Tall is Blueface Compared To Yung Gravy?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-8" href=# title="Why is Blueface so Tall?">Why is Blueface so Tall?</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-9" href=# title="Blueface is Involved in Sports Which Has Helped Him Stay Fit">Blueface is Involved in Sports Which Has Helped Him Stay Fit</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-10" href=# title="Blueface Trained For His Bare-Knuckle Boxing Debut in July 2021">Blueface Trained For His Bare-Knuckle Boxing Debut in July 2021</a></li><li class=ez-toc-page-1><a class="ez-toc-link ez-toc-heading-11" href=# title="Blueface Grew Up With an Interest in Basketball and Music">Blueface Grew Up With an Interest in Basketball and Music</a></li></ul><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=summary-of-bluefaces-biography></span><strong>Summary of Blueface’s Biography</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><ul><li><strong>FULL NAME:</strong> Johnathan Jamall Porter</li><li><strong>STAGE NAME:</strong> Blueface Bleedem</li><li><strong>AGE:</strong> 26 Years Old</li><li><strong>BIRTHDAY:</strong> January 20th, 1997</li><li><strong>BIRTHPLACE:</strong> Los Angeles, California, United States</li><li><strong>BIRTH SIGN:</strong> Aquarius</li><li><strong>ETHNICITY:</strong> Mixed</li><li><strong>FATHER:</strong> Johnathan M.

He is 6 feet 4 inches tall, which translates to 193 centimeters and 76 inches. He is one of the tallest rappers in the industry and this has definitely improved his career in several ways. Considering the fact that he is still young, there are chances that he might even still grow taller.</p><p>His height gave him an advantage right from his high school where he had the opportunity to play basketball and even represent the school in several competitions. Blueface could have made a career out of basketball if he wanted to as he was that good. His athletism has contributed to him keeping fit despite the fact that he no longer plays basketball professionally.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=bluefaces-height-places-him-above-the-average-american-man-and-most-male-rappers></span><strong>Blueface’s Height Places Him Above The Average American Man and Most Male Rappers</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Blueface’s height of 193 cm is quite astonishing which is why there’s so much fuss about it. He is taller than most American men as the Center for Disease Control (CDC) places the average height of an American male above 20 at 5 feet 9 inches which translates to 175.4 cm and 69.1 inches. Compared to Blueface’s 193 cm, the difference is clear.</p><p>Compared to other rappers, Blueface’s height continues to set him apart. According to an analysis on celebheight.com, the average height for an American rapper is 5 feet 10 inches. This means Blueface is about 8 inches taller than the average American rapper. Here is a comparison of his height to some other contemporary rappers.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=bluefaces-height-compared-to-ddg></span><strong>Blueface’s Height Compared to DDG</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>DDG is the stage name for Darryl Granberry Jr. He is 5 feet 8 inches (1.73m, 173cm) tall which makes him about 11 inches shorter than Blueface who is 6 feet 4 inches. In terms of popularity, DDG who earned most of his own fame through YouTube before switching to other online platforms such as SoundCloud has gained more recognition than Blueface.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=bluefaces-height-compared-to-dababy></span><strong>Blueface’s Height Compared to Dababy</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Dababy is one of the most talented rappers in America today. He was actually instrumental in the skyrocketing of Blueface’s rap career, especially with his contribution to Dababy’s hit song “Obama”.</p><p>However, when one compares the height of the two rappers, Dababy might probably be embarrassed. Compared to Blueface’s 6 feet 4 inches height, Dababy is 5 feet 8 inches tall which means he needs about 8 inches to catch up with his Blueface.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-blueface-taller-than-lil-mosey></span><strong>Is Blueface Taller than Lil Mosey?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Lil Mosey, like Blueface, is another upcoming artist in the American rap industry. He is also another rapper who Blueface surpasses in height. Lil Mosey is 5 feet 7 inches tall. If the two rappers were to stand side by side, Lil Mosey will be dwarfed by Blueface’s 6 feet 4 inches height.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-tall-is-blueface-compared-to-yung-gravy></span><strong>How Tall is Blueface Compared To Yung Gravy?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Yung Gravy is one of the few rappers taller than Blueface. He is 6 feet 6 inches (198 cm) tall which places him 2 inches ahead of Blueface. Yung Gravy who is quite the sensation first earned his recognition in 2016 after his song “Mr. Clean” gained traction on SoundCloud. The song charted 89 in Australia and is now RIAA-certified Platinum.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-is-blueface-so-tall></span><strong>Why is Blueface so Tall?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The logical explanation for Blueface’s enormous height will be his genes. From what has been gathered about him, he takes after his father as his mother is also of average height.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=blueface-is-involved-in-sports-which-has-helped-him-stay-fit></span><strong>Blueface is Involved in Sports Which Has Helped Him Stay Fit</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Blueface is actually one of the tallest and most physically attractive rappers in recent times. The Thotiana crooner isn’t shy to flaunt his great physique as he likes to perform shirtless showing off his abs. This has left his fans wondering what he does to remain in shape.</p><p>Even though he hasn’t come out to outrightly speak about his workout and diet routine, Blueface is sports-inclined and this is a very good way to keep fit.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=blueface-trained-for-his-bare-knuckle-boxing-debut-in-july-2021></span><strong>Blueface Trained For His Bare-Knuckle Boxing Debut in July 2021</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Asides from basketball, Blueface has also ventured into bare-knuckle boxing. Most people believe boxing to be a therapeutic sport as it is one way to expel frustration, especially for youths with several pent-up emotions. It’s uncertain when and why Blueface picked up an interest in the sports but he hired pro-boxer- David Kaminsky to train him ahead of his fight with TikTok influencer Kane Trujillo.</p><p>He was bent on winning the $25,000 knockout bonus so he dedicated himself to rigorous training. His trainer- David Kaminsky praised his dedication to practice and expressed confidence in his abilities. He also spoke a little about his workout and diet routine. Blueface had to visit the gym daily to work on his non-contact punches. He also abstained from unhealthy foods. Blueface was rewarded for his hard work and sacrifice as he defeated Kane Trujillo on the 23rd of July 2021.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=blueface-grew-up-with-an-interest-in-basketball-and-music></span><strong>Blueface Grew Up With an Interest in Basketball and Music</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Born in Los Angeles, California on the 20th of January 1997, Blueface grew up in central Los Angeles Mid-City. As a child, he attended several elementary schools before finally moving and settling in with his mother in Santa Clarita Valley. Not long after, he had to move again to go live with his father in Oakland. He finally moved to San Fernando Valley where he attended high school. He schooled at Arleta High School where his interest in music and sports blossomed.</p><p>While he was a student at Arleta High School, Blueface joined the football team where he played as the starting quarterback in 2014. His height of 6’4” stood him out in the game and he did exceptionally well. In 2014, he led the team to an East Valley League championship. Blueface began to take an interest in rap music at a young age this made him join the marching band where he played alto saxophone in high school. He listened and looked up to rappers like Snoop Dogg, 50 Cent, and The Game.</p><p>After high school, Blueface’s talents didn’t go unnoticed, he committed himself to play for Fayetteville State University. Even though he left in 2016, he briefly played college football. In reference to his experience as a football player. His video of the remix of his song “Thotiana” was a reflection of his past where he portrays a high school quarterback player who was full of prospects but was very disrespectful to his coach because he wants to pursue fame and women.</p><p>For a young rapper, Blueface has a lot of confidence which is one of the reasons he continues to stand out. His incredible height, tattoos, and talent have been a major propelling force in his career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKCfrHqwuMNmoKxlkqHCprLAnJxmmZ6Zeri0wK1koqtdnba0eceeoKCgpGQ%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./legionaere.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Iran - Foreigners | Transfermarkt">&larr;
