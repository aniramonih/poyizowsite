Born in Waterloo, New South Wales, he grew up with his brother, <strong>Austin Howard</strong>. His father, <strong>Nick Howard</strong>, is a respected music producer and sound engineer with a roster of successful Australian musicians to his name, including <strong>Brigitte Bardot</strong> and <strong>Delta Goodrem</strong>. His mother, <strong>Sloane Howard</strong>, was a formidable figure in the industry, having founded her record label and managed successful artists, such as Popstars winner Scott Cain.</p><h3>Read Also!!</h3><p>However,&nbsp;<strong>The Kid LAROI</strong>‘s upbringing was far from idyllic. His maternal great-great-grandfather was part of the Stolen Generation, a group of Indigenous Australians who were forcibly removed from their families as children. He is of Gamilaraay (or Kamilaroi) descent from this ancestor, which inspired his artistic name,&nbsp;<strong>Laroi</strong>.</p><p>As a child,&nbsp;<strong>The Kid LAROI</strong>‘s father was not a consistent presence in his life, and his uncle became a father figure to him. Tragically, his uncle was murdered in 2015, profoundly affecting the young artist. He has said that his motivation for success comes from a desire to avoid his uncle’s fate and make him proud.</p><p>Further upheaval came with his parents’ divorce when he was four.&nbsp;<strong>The Kid LAROI</strong>&nbsp;has spoken openly about his family’s struggles, including his mother occasionally selling narcotics to make ends meet. When he was seven years old, the family moved to the rural town of Broken Hill in New South Wales, where he attended <strong>Sacred Heart Parish School</strong> and won a speech competition.</p><p>After leaving Broken Hill,&nbsp;<strong>The Kid LAROI</strong>&nbsp;moved to Adelaide, where he attended <strong>Sacred Heart College</strong> for a time. However, he was bullied, and his mother could no longer afford his education, so they returned to Sydney in 2017. He received a scholarship to the <strong>Australian Performing Arts Grammar School</strong> but left midway through year nine to pursue his international career.</p><p>During this time, the family lived in a Housing Commission building in Redfern, and&nbsp;<strong>The Kid LAROI</strong>&nbsp;moved around to stay with friends. In a 2021 interview, he revealed that his mother is his best friend, and he wanted to assist her financially, so he got a part-time job at a fruit store. Despite the challenges he faced in his childhood,&nbsp;<strong>The Kid LAROI</strong>‘s talent and dedication have propelled him to international stardom, inspiring fans worldwide.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Career></span>Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Charlton Kenneth Jeffrey Howard</strong>, better known by his stage name,&nbsp;<strong>The Kid LAROI</strong>, has been on quite the musical journey from his humble beginnings in Waterloo, New South Wales. Growing up in a broken home with a father who was not present in his life, Howard found solace in music, recording raps over beats on his mother’s phone. Here, he discovered his love of music and set himself on a path to greatness.</p><p>In 2017,&nbsp;<strong>The Kid LAROI</strong>&nbsp;signed a development deal with Sony Music Australia, which set him on his professional trajectory. He released his debut mixtape,&nbsp;<strong>14 With a Dream</strong>, which featured collaborations with <strong>Manu Crooks</strong>, <strong>B Wise</strong>, and <strong>Miracle</strong>. However, when he formed a partnership with Grade A Productions and Columbia Records in March 2019, he gained international recognition. His music video for <strong>Let Her Go</strong>, uploaded on the<strong> Lyrical Lemonade</strong> YouTube channel, was a game-changer, and he quickly became a household name.</p><p><strong>The Kid LAROI</strong>‘s music continued to evolve, and in early 2020, he released <strong>Diva</strong>, featuring <strong>Lil Tecca</strong>. He followed up with <strong><a href=#>Addison Rae</a></strong>, a song named after the social media star, which was released on March 22. His music continued to gain traction with <strong>Fade Away</strong>, released on April 17, and <strong>Go</strong>, a collaboration with the late <strong><a href=#>Juice Wrld</a></strong>, released on June 12.</p><p>On July 24, 2020, he released his critically acclaimed mixtape, <strong>F*ck Love</strong>, which included appearances by <strong><strong><a href=#>Juice WRLD</a></strong></strong>, <strong>Corbin</strong>, and <strong><a href=#>Lil Mosey</a></strong>. The mixtape was a massive success and catapulted <strong>The Kid LAROI</strong> into mainstream consciousness.</p><p>Despite his success,&nbsp;<strong>The Kid LAROI</strong>&nbsp;was not content to rest on his laurels. In June 2021, he parted ways with Grad A Productions and signed a management contract with <strong>Scooter Braun</strong>. Shortly after, he released <strong>Fck Love 3: Over You</strong>, his second deluxe edition of <strong>Fck Love</strong>, featuring guest appearances from <a href=#>Lil Durk</a>, <strong><a href=#>Polo G</a></strong>, <a href=#>G Herbo</a>, and <strong>Stunna Gambino</strong>, among others. However, he recently made headlines again after leaving <strong>Scooter Braun</strong>‘s management and signing with <strong>Adam Leber</strong> at <strong>Rebel Management</strong>.</p><p><strong>The Kid LAROI</strong>‘s musical journey has been nothing short of impressive. He has collaborated with some of the biggest names in the music industry, including <strong>Internet Money</strong>, <strong>Y2K</strong>, <strong><a href=#>Miley Cyrus</a></strong>, and <strong><a href=#>Justin Bieber</a></strong>. His unique sound has been featured in numerous fashion editorials, including Flaunt magazine, and he graced the cover of Wondaland magazine in the Autumn of 2021.&nbsp;<strong>The Kid LAROI</strong>&nbsp;is a musical force to be reckoned with, and there’s no doubt that he’ll continue to make waves in the music industry for years to come.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Discography></span>Discography<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><ul><li>Tell Me Why</li><li>So Done</li><li>Go</li><li>Diva</li><li>Let Her Go</li><li>Addison Rae</li><li>Winning</li><li>Blessings</li><li>Need You Most</li><li>Stay</li><li>Reminds Me of You</li><li>Without You</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Personal_Life></span>Personal Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><a href=#>Katarina Demetriades</a>, also known as <a href=#>Katarina Deme</a>, and&nbsp;<strong>The Kid LAROI</strong>&nbsp;began their romantic entanglement on the auspicious day of July 24, 2020.
