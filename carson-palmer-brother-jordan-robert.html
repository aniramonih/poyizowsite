He idolized watching Carson play high school football on Friday nights.</p><p>His elder brother was also the reason why Jordan pursued a football career.</p><p>Similarly, an incident that shows the supportive nature of Carson.</p><p>During the Palmer brothers’ time with the Bengals, the younger Palmer had a contract with no guarantees. That meant Jordan could well be cut at any time.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>CARSON REPORTEDLY</a> tried to walk away from his contractual obligations hoping to provide an opportunity for his little brother.</p><p>After a few months of being stoically silent, Carson accused the team of spitting on his younger brother.</p><p>Carson Palmer told his friend that he believes the team is “toying” with Jordan by giving him reduced reps and eventually cutting him too late to land with a new team.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunCvwKuqqKZdpa6tucSrZJuqn6m1pr6Mo6arnJGjerO7wZ6prWc%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./1037581-chris-jericho-eddie-guerrero-tribute-cruise.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Chris Jericho Recalls First Meeting Eddie Guerrero, Vince McMahon Thinking Highly Of Eddie, Why He A">&larr;
