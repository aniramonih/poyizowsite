She fell instantly in love with Miguel Lopez-Fitzgerald and that led to her meeting Grace Bennett who turned out to be her aunt. Her house was set on fire by Tabitha (Harmony�s resident witch) and her mother is believed to have perished in the fire. Charity went to Harmony, but had lost her memory and was clueless about who she was. She slowly got her memory back and started to come into her special powers that ran in the women of her family. She continued to grow closer and closer to Miguel, but unfortunately her new found cousin Kay had her sights on Miguel.</p><p>Kay pulled stunt after stunt to try and put an end to Charity and Miguel�s relationship. Kay sold her soul to Hecuba and sent Charity to do actual time in the fires of Hell. She finally got rescued and announced her engagement to Miguel. Kay managed to reap havoc yet again when she used the book of spells to trap Charity and create her alter ego�.Zombie Charity. While Charity was frozen (literally), Zombie Charity carried out Kay�s plans to sabotage her relationship with Miguel and also to torture Tabitha and Timmy. That all changed though when Zombie Charity started to think for herself. She planned to seduce Miguel and kill him and also to kill Timmy before he could use the Demon�s Horn to free the real Charity. Luckily the Demon�s Horn was used to free Charity, but she was seriously injured in the process and ended up in the hospital. She was in desperate need of a heart transplant, and Tabitha�s grand-nephew (her beloved living doll) Timmy was the donor. Thanks to his heart, Charity was able to live.</p><p>Later Kay announced to the world that she was pregnant and that Miguel was the father. Charity being the good person that she was certainly did not want to deprive the child of a father, but she still loved Miguel with all of her heart. She made the decision to give him up, but later they found their way back to each other. Kay was furious and turned to Tabitha and Endora to fix the situation. Thanks to them, Charity was placed in Reese�s bed and Miguel found her there. The couple broke up and Charity became closer to Reese. Charity left town after many attempts to reconcile with Miguel. She returned to Castleton where her home burned down. Miguel chased after her and was there when she was attacked and almost killed by a dog. He speared the dog (saving Charity�s life) and when he went over to it, he found Kay lying there with a spear in her. Miguel begged Charity to stay in Harmony, but she took Tabitha�s suggestion and left town.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirn5a9tHrSoZykpp%2BswG%2BvzqZmqZmjqLawutJomqGZopawtbHRrGacoJGntrXFjKyrmqaUnsCpew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./coco-chanel-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Coco Chanel Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr;
