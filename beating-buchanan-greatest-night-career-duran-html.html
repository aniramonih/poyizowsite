Honestly, Kenny and I are good friends now. We like to joke about it.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Good-natured joshing and time-heals-all-wounds camaraderie aside, Duran has reason to recall that Buchanan fight as a defining moment in a career that saw him fight in five different decades, competing in 119 professional bouts — and winning world titles at four weights.</p><img id=i-441f4b270318e8e4 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/04/26/00/1266396200000514-0-The_Panamanian_will_meet_fans_in_Glasgow_for_a_special_Hands_of_-m-57_1493162594358.jpg height=674 width=634 alt="The Panamanian will meet fans in Glasgow for a special ‘Hands of Stone’ lunch this Sunday" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The Panamanian will meet fans in Glasgow for a special ‘Hands of Stone’ lunch this Sunday</p><img id=i-42567fa099a8868e src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/04/26/00/3F9B471600000578-0-image-a-70_1493164090720.jpg height=472 width=634 alt="Duran, nicknamed 'Hands of Stone', &nbsp;went to war three times with America's Sugar Ray Leonard" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Duran, nicknamed 'Hands of Stone', &nbsp;went to war three times with America's Sugar Ray Leonard</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘That was the most important fight of my career, against Ken,’ he declares of that Madison Square Garden sell-out in the summer of ’72.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It was my first fight for a world title, so it meant everything to me.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I remember that Ken was a great champion.

It means that much to me.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Throwing a Scotsman into the conversation is guaranteed to go down well with fans gathering in Glasgow for a special ‘Hands of Stone’ lunch with Duran this Sunday — where Buchanan is scheduled to be a guest of honour, four-and-a-half decades on from his most painful moment in the ring.</p><img id=i-1757d9c6e81be774 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/04/26/00/3F9B478E00000578-0-image-a-71_1493164138601.jpg height=424 width=634 alt="Duran was one of the 'Four Kings' alonside Leonard, Tommy Hearns and Marvin Hagler (left)" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Duran was one of the 'Four Kings' alonside Leonard, Tommy Hearns and Marvin Hagler (left)</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Duran is currently in the UK on a speaking tour, finding himself bowled over by the welcome from fans who recall him with great affection. Amazing how perceptions can change, isn’t it?</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Those of us old enough to have revelled in every moment of his rivalry with Leonard, in particular, haven’t quite forgotten that he was usually cast as the villain when up against the golden boy of American boxing.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This was all happening at the tail-end of Muhammad Ali’s all-consuming greatness as a champion, remember. Boxing was looking for heroes and guys willing to wear the black hat.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Between them, the quartet of Leonard, Duran, Hagler and Hearns provided a fresh bout of explosive drama on a regular basis; there were only nine fights between the four of them, but, at the time, you would have sworn they faced each other every other weekend.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Duran has never given Leonard a satisfactory answer to questions about his infamous ‘No mas’ retiral in their incredible 1980 rematch — former Olympic champion Sugar Ray avenging his unanimous points loss of just five months earlier. Yet, he remains widely regarded as easily among the best five or ten fighters ever to pull on gloves.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>This is a guy who emerged triumphant from the Brawl in Montreal by battering Leonard to a standstill. Who fought with a broken hand and still took Hagler 15 rounds.</p><img id=i-6d6a11c80e4cf7fb src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/04/26/00/3F9B3BBB00000578-0-image-m-75_1493164204268.jpg height=644 width=634 alt="The 65-year-old, who is currently in the UK on a speaking tour, had 119 fights as a professional" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>The 65-year-old, who is currently in the UK on a speaking tour, had 119 fights as a professional</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Inevitably, just as tennis fans will forever ask how many Grand Slam titles Andy Murray might have won had he been born a few years earlier, boxing aficionados can’t help but ponder how Duran would have cleaned up in a different age.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Especially in the current era, where it has become acceptable for fighters to duck the toughest challenges while padding out their records.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>All on pay-per-view TV with its purse-busting revenue streams.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘God put me in boxing at this time,’ is how Duran puts it. ‘So that time was right — and it was enough for me. Looking back on some of those great fights and rivalries, some of the things we did, I wouldn’t change it for anything.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘But, if you are talking about money, maybe I would have liked to have fought in this era.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘The Four Kings, we never thought of saying no to a fight against each other. It’s totally true that everybody would just fight each other to find out who was the best in the division.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Now, there is so much money involved and everyone seems to avoid each other. Boxing nowadays is not the same. If I was to pick out one fighter that I really like, I would be lying.’</p><img id=i-d4c801121fc9373c src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2017/04/26/00/3F9B46C200000578-0-image-a-73_1493164187632.jpg height=404 width=634 alt="Duran climbs off the canvas during his loss to 'the Hitman' Tommy Hearns in Las Vegas in 1984" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Duran climbs off the canvas during his loss to 'the Hitman' Tommy Hearns in Las Vegas in 1984</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>His question-and-answer sessions during these tours are unlikely to be short of material, given the sheer breadth of Duran’s career. From that first officially sanctioned professional fight in 1968 until he bowed out in 2001, he fought ’em all.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>To give you an idea of the eras he spanned, consider this. Over the duration, Duran — now 65 — fought both Buchanan, very much a boxer of the 1970s and Hector Camacho, undoubtedly a 21st Century man.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Given the short duration of sporting lives, that is the pugilistic equivalent of shaking the hand of the guy who shook the hand of, well, if not Moses, then certainly Abraham Lincoln.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Now he gets the chance to recount some of those favourite tales for an adoring audience, admitting: ‘I didn’t ever think I would be remembered by so many people, that I would feel so loved. This makes me very happy, obviously.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘The fans all over the world want to know the same things. They want to speak about the era of the Four Kings, my life.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘They ask about all my fights, not just the famous ones. I find it very interesting to tell some of the old stories again.’</p>&nbsp;<p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-italic>TO book your tickets for Lunch With A Legend: ‘Hands of Stone Roberto Duran’, call Claire at Ignite Promotions on 07715683448.
