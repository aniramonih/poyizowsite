To attain his musical success, the icon honed his vocal skills from childhood, making it a part of him.</p><p>It isn’t surprising then that Mars made his childhood passion into a career. Notably, he has his <a href=#>parents</a> to thank for his tremendous talent, as they each had their run in the music industry during their youth.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>In Fact, Bruno Mars’ parents owe their meeting and resulting love story to music which has become the backbone upon which their beautiful family was built.</p><p>So who are his parents, and what do we know about them besides their impact on their son’s life and career?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Are_Bruno_Mars_Parents></span><strong>Who Are Bruno Mars’ Parents</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Bruno Mars came into the world on October 8, 1985, to <a href=#>parents</a> Peter Hernandez and Bernadette San Pedro Bayot.</p><p>At birth, he received the name Peter Gene Hernandez, named after his dad, but eventually embraced Bruno Mars as a stage name at the early stage of his career to seem more American.</p><p>Notably, Bruno Mars was one of six children born to his parents and grew up in Hawaii watching his parents perform. One thing the family of eight had in common was their passion for music, which Peter and Bernadette imbibed in their kids from a young age.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Peter_Hernandez></span><strong>Who Is Peter Hernandez?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/20220504_160412-1024x968.jpg><p><a href=#>Peter Hernandez</a> is the father of Philippine singer Bruno Mars. He was born in Brooklyn, New York City, and has Puerto Rican and Ashkenazi Jewish descent.</p><p>Growing up, Hernandez discovered his knack for the performing arts and honed those skills into his adulthood. Hence, he embraced music as a career in his youth, working as a percussionist.</p><p>He also performed as part of the 50s-style group Doo-Wop and owns an Elvis Presley museum in Hawaii. As part of his act, Mars’ dad impersonated famous performers like Elvis, earning him an impressive audience.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Bruno_Mars_Mom></span><strong>Bruno Mars’ Mom</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Bernadette San Pedro Bayot was a singer and hula dancer. The entertainer, born in the Philippines in 1957 moved to the United States at ten along with family members.</p><p>She eventually relocated to Hawaii in pursuit of her dancing and singing dreams. While in Hawaii, Bernadette worked as a hula dancer for a band.</p><p>During one of her shows, she met Peter Hernandez, who also performed at the event as a percussionist. Thus, their love story began.</p><p>Mars credits Bernadette with getting him his first keyboard at the age of two, which was a significant step in making him into a world-class singer.</p><p>By the time Bruno Mars turned four, he was already performing with his parents in the family’s music band. According to reports, the star wrote his first song ever at that age, utilizing the lyrics to sing odes to his mom. Bruno Mars’ Mom lived in Hawaii until her death in 2013.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_Did_Bernadette_Bayot_Die></span><strong>How Did Bernadette Bayot Die?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Bernadette San Pedro Bayot died on June 3, 2013, a day that admittedly changed Mars’ perspective forever. A representative for the American crooner confirmed the news, saying she passed away at 55.</p><p>Bernadette died of a brain aneurysm at Queen Medical Centre in Honolulu, Hawaii, leaving the music legend heartbroken. Opening up about the loss, the 36-year-old revealed that his life changed ever since.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Bruno Mars, who had close ties with both parents, also admitted that if given the choice, he would trade music any day just to have his mom back.</p><p>Reports show the parents of six were already divorced and living separately at the time of Bernadette’s death. Yet, they bore the loss as one big united family, standing by each other.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Are_Bruno_Mars_Siblings></span><strong>Who Are Bruno Mars’ Siblings</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Aside from Bruno Mars, Peter and Bernadette were parents to five other kids including sisters Tiara, Tahiti, Presley, and Jamie. Mars has one brother, Eric Hernandez, best known as the drummer in the “Lazy Song” crooner’s infamous band, The Hooligans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/20220504_160327.jpg><p>Notably, all of the Grammy-winner’s siblings are as talented as him and nurture their interest in music. His sisters perform as part of the girl music group, The Lylas, following in their parent’s footsteps.</p><p>Bruno Mars remains the most famous of his siblings and continues making his mark in the industry. He has several <a href=#>awards</a> up his sleeves, becoming one of a few Philippine singers to attain international stardom.</p><p>Perhaps his <a href=#>name change</a> and decision to pursue American music rather than Spanish music as many initially suggested was the spark his career needed. It certainly paid off!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kuqax02aZq62epHqurdGsZKmZopq7tb%2BMsJ%2BoZZiaubGxw2aZrqGcmXqptdJmmpqqlZq%2FcA%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./thomas-boyer-bryan.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Meet Thomas Boyer Bryan: Luke Bryans Son  Everything to Know">&larr;
