His face was slashed severely with a 007 flick knife. The wound required 400 stitches in total.</strong></p><p><strong>Teddy Atlas</strong> is a boxing <a href=#><strong>trainer</strong></a> and commentator from the United States. Although he worked as an assistant to <strong>D'Amato</strong>, his time at the Catskill Boxing Club was brief. His responsibilities included assisting in the training of D'Amato's adolescent protégé, Mike Tyson. The boxing trainee achieved his greatest success as <strong>Michael Moorer</strong>'s head trainer, guiding him to the world heavyweight title in 1994. He worked as an ESPN analyst, first for ESPN2's Friday Night matches and Wednesday Night Fights, and then for ESPN's Premier Boxing Champions matches.</p><p>In a recent interview, Hall of Fame trainer Teddy Atlas questioned the former undisputed heavyweight champion <strong>Mike Tyson</strong>'s status as an all-time great. Along with the news, he has talked about his love for boxing and shared about his face scar and how he got it too. So let us get into detail and learn about his scar.</p><p>Earlier, we discussed the <a href=#><strong>stories</strong></a> of <a href=#><strong>Lee Sun-kyun</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Mike Williams</strong></a>.</p><h2>Teddy Atlas’ Face Was Slashed With a Knife, Leaving Behind a Scar</h2><p>You might have clearly seen <strong>Teddy Atlas</strong>' (<a href=# rel=noopener>@teddy_atlas</a>) face scar, where he has a big straight cut that looks like someone tried to harm him. His scar starts from his left side of the forehead to down to the chin, a straight, deep cut, and fans can't help but discuss it. No wonder it has led to several questions, like how did he get it and did he do any kind of treatment for it? What did the boxing trainer say about it in his podcast?</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2024/01/teddy-atlas-face-scar-1.jpg alt="Teddy Atlas was&nbsp;involved in a big fight that led to his scar. celebsindepth.com" width=575 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 575px) 100vw, 575px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong><span>Teddy Atlas was&nbsp;involved in a big fight that led to his scar.<br></span></strong><strong>Source: BoxRec</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Well, in a 20-minute video that is available on YouTube with the title Story Behind Teddy Atlas's Face Scar, he has revealed every detail about his boxing career and also about his scar. He revealed that he got scar by getting involved in violent fights with other children. He revealed that the fight resulted in cuts leaving behind the scar.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Talking about his early ears he revealed that he was angry and has no idea why every time he was angry and can relate his anger to today's generation children. When asked the total detail story behind his car he said that he was just running doing stupid bad things. He admitted to having a rough, rebellious childhood. Teddy Atlas dropped out of school and was arrested on multiple occasions.</p><p>Going in depth about the story about his scar, he said that he was involved in a street brawl in Stapleton, Staten Island, during which his face was slashed severely with a 007 flick knife. The wound required 400 stitches in total, with 200 on the exterior and 200 on the inside of his face. He was scarred as a result of the incident. He said that it was warm and gooey. When <strong>Lex Fridman</strong> (<a href=# rel=noopener>@lexfridman</a>) further questioned the boxing trainer, asking if he thought about his dad during the incident, the commentator revealed that Teddy Atlas remembered his dad's words. And the cut has left behind a sac, which is still visible.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><h2>Teddy Atlas Has Questioned Mike Tyson’s Status as an All-Time Great</h2><p><strong>Atlas Teddy</strong> began his boxing career as an amateur under Hall of Fame trainer <strong>Cus D'Amato</strong>. He fought as an amateur and won a 135-pound Golden Gloves title before being forced to work as a trainer due to a back problem. In a recent interview, Hall of Fame trainer Teddy <a href=# rel=noopener>questioned</a> the former undisputed heavyweight champion <strong>Mike Tyson</strong>'s status as an all-time great.</p><p>Tyson, the sport's youngest heavyweight champion, is largely regarded as one of the sport's finest and most noteworthy figures. He was the first heavyweight fighter to simultaneously hold the WBA, WBC, and IBF belts. While Atlas does not doubt Tyson's abilities, he does have one criticism.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebsindepth.com/storage/2024/01/teddy-atlas-face-scar-2.jpg alt="Teddy Atlas said Mike Tyson took advantage of other people's weaknesses. celebsindepth.com" width=862 height=720 sizes="(max-width: 862px) 100vw, 862px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><strong>Teddy Atlas said Mike Tyson took advantage of other people's weaknesses.<br></strong><strong>Source: Instagram</strong></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>Atlas was dismissed from the camp in 1982 after a fight with a 15-year-old Tyson. Atlas said Tyson had been sexually inappropriate with an 11-year-old female relative of Atlas, which resulted in an altercation in which Atlas threatened to kill Tyson with a firearm. While Atlas admires Tyson's skill set, he is not convinced that Tyson was an all-around 'great' fighter.</p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>He admitted that he doesn't remember ever being fantastic on the <strong>Lex Fridman</strong> Podcast. He even stated that Tyson understood he was the greatest combination of speed and power ever, adding that he doesn't know if anyone other than <strong>Joe Louis</strong> and a few others could punch as well as Tyson did on either side with either hand. Atlas Teddy further added, Tyson took advantage of other people's weaknesses, whether because he was afraid or because his talent was so much higher than theirs that it was like putting a monster truck in with a Volkswagen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7%2FIp5ueqKSde6S7zGirnpyUrnqiwMuaqmaekZiybr%2FCmqlo</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./leonardo-dicaprio-favourite-mexican-dish-recipe.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Try Leo DiCaprios Go-To Mexican Dish For Your Next Dinner Party">&larr;
