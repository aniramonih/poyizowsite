This Dominican professional baseball shortstop for the Tampa Bay Rays known as “El Patron” made headlines not only for his MLB debut in 2021, but also for a probe into his social media posts. The probe isn’t the only thing hanging over Franco. Fans and critics alike have questioned his recent benching owing to “behavior and attitude” issues and an ailment.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Wander Samuel Franco Aybar Sr., born in Ban, Dominican Republic, quickly rose to prominence in the baseball world. Baseball runs in his blood, thanks to his father, Wander Franco, who was a minor league player in the 1990s. He isn’t the only one in his family who enjoys baseball; his brothers Wander Javier Franco and Wander Alexander Franco have both played in the past decade.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>What Happened to Wander Franco?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>The Tampa Bay Rays issued a statement lately addressing their shortstop Wander Franco and the allegations leveled against him on social media. The team indicated that they were made aware of the social media remarks and that Major League Baseball is investigating the incident. The Rays have stated that they are taking the problem seriously and that they are in frequent contact with MLB as they conduct their due diligence.</p><p><a href=# rel="attachment wp-att-53388"><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/What-Happened-to-Wander-Franco.jpg alt="What Happened to Wander Franco" width=1200 height=628 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Kevin Cash, the Rays’ manager, addressed the speculation following the team’s loss to the Guardians, saying that he was aware of it but declining to make any further comments. Cash also confirmed that Franco’s absence from the roster on Sunday was due to a prearranged day off, not any additional problems.</p><p style=text-align:justify>Instead of Franco, the Rays used infielder Osleivis Basabe, who was brought up prior to the game, which forced lefty Josh Fleming to be demoted. Franco, 22, signed a long-term contract agreement with the Rays in November 2021 and has had a strong season, receiving his first All-Star Game selection and batting.281/.344/.475 in 112 games.</p><h2 style=text-align:justify>What Did Wander Franco Post?</h2><p style=text-align:justify>According to the Tampa Bay Times, deleted posts on X claimed Franco was in an inappropriate connection with a juvenile. It is crucial to emphasize, however, that these charges have not been proven or substantiated. On Sunday, Osleivis Basabe made his major league debut at shortstop. In the contest, the 22-year-old went 1 for 3 with a double. Basabe learned about his promotion to the major leagues during a Saturday night game with Triple-A Durham.</p><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by MLB Dominicana (@mlbdominicana)</a></p><p style=text-align:justify>Franco, on the other hand, started the Rays’ game on Sunday but left in the fifth inning. Later, it was found that the team had given him the day off. During that game, the Rays held a promotion for fans 14 and under, presenting the Wander Franco Snapback Hat. When queried about Franco’s absence, Rays manager Kevin Cash indicated that there was no problem other than the fact that it was a usual day off. Cash also declined to comment further on the rumors swirling around Franco’s condition.</p><p><strong>You can also read the additional news below:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=# rel=noopener>‘The Blind Side’ Michael Oher Claims Tuohy Family Adoption Is A Fraud And He Was Denied Movie Money</a></li><li><a href=# rel=noopener>Michael Burry Warning Stock Market Crash</a></li></ul><p style=text-align:justify>The Rays benched Franco for two games in late June owing to his reaction to frustrating situations and his teammate behavior. Despite this, Tampa Bay signed him to an 11-year, $182 million contract with a team option for 2033 that could raise the total value to $223 million. Franco, who was named an AL All-Star this season, has been on a tear, hitting.In 112 games, he batted 281 with 17 home runs, 58 RBIs, and 30 successful base steals out of 40 attempts.</p><p style=text-align:justify><strong><span id=conclusion>Conclusion: </span></strong>Wander Franco, who is only 22 years old, has shown tremendous potential. His trajectory is notable, from great stats to being a key member of the Tampa Bay Rays. Nonetheless, he, like many athletes, has hurdles. The outcome of the MLB inquiry, as well as Franco’s reaction to recent setbacks, will influence the next chapter of his intriguing career.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfo7K4v46wn5qsXZ2usbzEp5ydZaSkeritzZ2cq2WWp66vr85o</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./garrison-keillor-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What is Garrison Keillor Net Worth 2024: Bio, Age, Height, Family, And More">&larr;
