While he doesn’t talk much about his father or mother outside of the parents’ days, Melton does have a sister, Nicole Stracener. He also attended Lake Braddock Secondary School, according to the records.</p><p>Craig earned a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology from George Mason University, where he later earned a Master of Science in Telecommunication Management. Melton was also a member of George Mason’s Men’s Division I Soccer Team.</p><h2><span id=Craig_how_old_are_you>Craig, how old are you?</span></h2><p>51 years old as of 2023.</p><h2><span id=Craig_Melton8217s_occupation_is_unknown>Craig Melton’s occupation is unknown.</span></h2><p>Following graduation, the Hispanic part-time soccer player worked as an account executive at Savvis Communications in Herndon, Virginia.</p><p>He later worked as a senior account executive with Windstream Communications Telecom in Herndon. Doyle’s ex-husband left Windstream in June 2004 to work as a sales director at Deltek. He stayed for four years before transferring to SpringCM, a DocuSign subsidiary, to work as an enterprise sales representative.</p><p>Craig Melton is the ex-wife of writer Glennon Doyle and a Prevail Sales enterprise employee.Craig Melton, a George Mason University student and Prevail enterprise sales employee.</p><p>Melton returned to Privia as an enterprise sales representative from November 2011 to December 2016. Following that, the former husband of the New York Times best-selling author joined DecisionPoint Corporation as vice president of new technologies. He returned to work as an enterprise salesman for Visible Thread after serving there for less than a year.</p><h2><span id=What_happened_to_Craig_Melton>What happened to Craig Melton?</span></h2><p>Melton has been working in enterprise sales for PreVeil, a cyber security startup, since February 2021. Furthermore, he lives a lavish lifestyle and spends the most of his time with his family. He does, however, try to keep her away from the media and the spotlight the most of the time.</p><h2><span id=Craig8217s_Ex-Wife_Glennon_Doyle_How_Did_They_Meet>Craig’s Ex-Wife, Glennon Doyle, How Did They Meet?</span></h2><p>Craig met Doyle at an all-day bar crawl in Washington, DC on July 4, 2001. The latter was 24 years old at the time, while the former was a brawny part-time model and semi-pro soccer player.</p><p>Glennon and Craig, the former wife and husband, slept together the first night they met and began “drinking and drugging constantly,” the Burke-born writer admits in her 2013 memoir, Carry On, Warrior.</p><p>Glennon became pregnant not long after, but she chose to have the baby aborted. Craig offered to pay, but she turned him down, stating, “I’ve got it.”</p><p>Several months later, on Mother’s Day 2002, the James Madison University graduate found out she was pregnant for the second time. She made certain that she would not abort the child this time.</p><p>“I become aware, there on the floor, that I will have this baby,” Glennon writes in Love Warrior. She likewise soon gave up her addictions. The Ted Ex speaker married Craig soon after, wearing a rhinestone tiara and high heels to the ceremony.</p><p>Glennon describes her marriage to “a man I’d known for 10 sober nights” at a ceremony in his childhood lawn in Burke.</p><h2><span id=Craig_Melton_and_his_ex-wife_Glennon_had_three_children>Craig Melton and his ex-wife Glennon had three children.</span></h2><p>Craig and the Love Warrior writer welcomed a newborn boy called Chase shortly after their wedding. The three made their home in Fairfax, Virginia. Glennon then began taking Lexapro and working as a preschool teacher.</p><p>In 2006, she and the former soccer player turned salesman welcomed another child, a girl called Tish Melton after Glennon’s mother. Craig and Doyle became parents for the third time two years later, in 2008, when they welcomed Amma, named after the author’s sister, Amanda.</p><h2><span id=Craig_and_Glennon_stayed_together_despite_the_former8217s_infidelity>Craig and Glennon stayed together despite the former’s infidelity.</span></h2><p>Doyle claims in her book that she and Craig split up after Craig admitted to having an affair during a therapy session.</p><p>The schism between Doyle and Melton began just as the former Momastery writer was ready to achieve a significant breakthrough in her writing career. She had only recently begun to garner unexpected praise for her book of essays, “Carry On, Warrior.”</p><p>Within a week of posting them on Facebook, she was getting calls from New York book agents, and ten publishers were bidding for her first book’s rights. In April 2013, her book debuted at No. 3 on the New York Times bestseller list and eventually sold more than 200,000 copies.</p><p>However, a week before Doyle Melton was to go on tour to promote it, Craig admitted to her that he’d been cheating on her during their marriage.</p><p>Prior to then, they appeared to be having communication and sexual difficulties. Craig’s porn habit and illicit one-night stands were also accused by the Best All-Around Social Media winner. Some of the issues included Doyle’s simmering resentments and reluctance with physical contact.</p><p>Glennon says that she and Craig recovered from all of this via rage, sadness, self-exploration, a lot of counseling, and, finally, grace. Doyle detailed her marriage’s struggles with Craig and how they managed to salvage it for a while in her second novel, Love Warrior.</p><p>She reveals her ex-husband’s adultery in the book, and the memoir concludes with the Virginia native and Craig renewing their vows on the beach facing the Gulf of Mexico.</p><h2><span id=They_Split_Up_After_Glennon8217s_Publication>They Split Up After Glennon’s Publication</span></h2><p>Despite adultery and subsequent reconciliation, Doyle and Craig would split up between mid and late 2016.</p><p>She did so by first sending her an urgent text message one afternoon, indicating she needed to talk about something very serious. The message, according to the father of three, is similar to a 911 call, “like Code Red.” On the walk home, he wondered if Glennon had cancer or had become gay.</p><p>While he was relieved to learn it wasn’t cancer, a rush of “sadness, confusion, and anger” washed over him when Doyle discussed her sexual orientation with him. She also told him about her friendship with Abby Wambach, a celebrity soccer champ, Olympian, activist, and author.</p><p>Craig recalls the event, saying,</p><p>“I felt we were doing things correctly. We’d both been working on ourselves. We’d entered what was supposed to be a new period in our lives. It was unexpected. It seemed as if the world had ended.”</p><p>However, the dark-haired former model felt he had no choice but to embrace his new situation. Glennon was about to release her second novel at the time. Craig was as understanding as he could be, and he now has shared custody of the children with the Fast Company Queer 50 member.</p><h2><span id=Craig_Melton_knows_Glennon8217s_current_partner>Craig Melton knows Glennon’s current partner.</span></h2><p>Craig, Abby, and Glennon are practically the epitome of good co-parenting right now.</p><p>In fact, Melton and Abby, his ex-partner’s current wife, occasionally serve as co-mentors for their children’s soccer team. Abby also has fond memories of her wife’s ex-husband, Craig. She says of the Psychology student,</p><p>“Craig gave me the biggest gift by allowing me into the family dynamic,” Wambach adds. “He gave the kids permission to fall in love with me.”</p><p>Craig and Wambach have even played on the same adult-league soccer squad. According to reports, Oprah Winfrey was among the first few people to learn of Glennon’s coming out and her connection with her present husband, Abby.</p><p>In fact, before to going public with her sexual orientation and love for Wambach, Oprah told her audience, ‘Get ready. The massacre will take place tomorrow.’ Glennon announced her coming out the next day by posting a selfie of herself and Abby on her Facebook page and captioned it,</p><p>“It feels like the world right now could use all the love it can get.” So today I’m going to tell you about my new passion. Abby is her given name. You probably know her from soccer.”</p><p>The bulk of Untamed’s admirers backed her. Melton and Wambach announced their engagement in February 2017 with a Facebook post that included two very dazzling engagement rings. They married in May of this year.</p><h2><span id=Craig_Melton_Has_A_New_Wife>Craig Melton Has A New Wife?</span></h2><p>While Doyle appears to be overjoyed and content with her new soccer coach partner, not much has been said about the celebrity spouse, Craig Melton. Craig, on the other hand, was supposed to have married a girl named Aleena, which proved out to be false.</p><p>Although she briefly revealed on Instagram that the father of her children was seeing someone, she never revealed who Craig’s then-partner was.</p><p>In any event, it appears that the relationship ended a long time ago, as Craig hasn’t mentioned having a love partner on social media in a long time. Either that, or the soccer coach keeps his love life to himself.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
