Rich guitars – mainly the Warlock, but also sporting the Rich Bich on occasion. His personal Warlock was a USA made Custom, with mohagany body, maple neck, and ebony fretboard. It sported the old style B.C. Rich “R” logo, and could be seen with either a gloss black finish with white binding, or red with contrasting black binding. It had custom “HATE” inlays at the fifth through second fretboard positions. There were no other fretboard markers. It had a hardtail bridge, dual EMG humbuckers in the bridge and neck position, and three-way pickup selector wired to a volume control. There was also an NJ Warlock Signature Series offered for retail sale. Visually, this version differed from his custom model in that it had a rosewood fretboard, the B.C. Rich script logo imprint on the headstock and “Mick #7” signature reproduced on the backside of the headstock, as well as a “Signature Series” 12th fret inlay.</p><p align=justify>Thomson married his girlfriend Stacy Riley on October 5, 2012.

The guitarist’s mask would remain much the same throughout his career, with only minor changes made for each album cycle, which he claimed was because he “pretty much nailed it … for being able to get across how I am”. Speaking in 2008, Thomson played down the amount of consideration which went into the mask’s design and meaning, proclaiming that “I had my original latex hockey mask way back and then my leather one and I was using those designs and it morphed into what it is now. There isn’t something crazy creative about it.” Thomson also chose #7 in the band, claiming that it was his “lucky number”.</p><h2>Top Facts about Mick Thomson</h2><li>Mick Thomson is the lead guitarist for Slipknot.</li><li>He was born on November 3, 1973 in Iowa.</li><li>Thomson joined Slipknot in 1996.</li><li>He is known for his aggressive playing style and heavy riffs.</li><li>Thomson has been nominated for multiple Grammy Awards with Slipknot.</li><li>He has also released solo material under the name “Mick Thomson”.</li><li>Thomson uses custom-made Ibanez guitars on stage and in the studio.</li><li>He is a self-taught musician who started playing guitar at age 15.</li><li>Thomson has collaborated with other metal bands such as Soulfly and Malevolent Creation.</li><li>His net worth is estimated to be around $14 million USD as of 2021.</li><h3>Facts & Trivia</h3><p>Mick Ranked on the list of <strong>most popular Guitarist</strong>.
