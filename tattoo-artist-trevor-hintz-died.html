He was larger than life, a trait that followed him into adulthood, where he developed a career as a successful tattoo artist. People traveled from far and wide to get inked by Trevor, who was known for his intricate and creative designs.</p><p>Despite his bold and outgoing persona, Trevor was someone who always put others first. He was especially devoted to his daughter, Nora, who he was a positive role model for. While he may have lived on the edge, taking risks and enjoying a bit of danger, it was always done with a good heart.</p><p>Tattooing was not just a job for Trevor; it was a passion. He loved the art form and the community that surrounded it. His bold, vibrant creations were a reflection of his personality, and his clients often became his friends. He was deeply invested in his craft, always honing his skills and discovering new techniques. His loss is felt deeply not just by those who knew him personally, but also by the tattoo community at large.</p><p>When he wasn’t at the tattoo parlor, Trevor enjoyed spending time with friends, traveling, and playing video games. He had a curious mind and was tech-savvy, always tinkering with his computer or vehicle. His adventurous spirit made him a beloved member of the community, and he will be missed by many.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading style=font-size:25px><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tattoo_Artist_Trevor_Hintz_Death_What_was_the_cause_of_his_death></span><strong>Tattoo Artist Trevor Hintz Death: What was the cause of his death?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The exact cause of Trevor’s death has yet to be determined, but what we do know is that his legacy will live on.
