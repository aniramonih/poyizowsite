As of June 2018, both of these restaurants have closed.</p><p>Voltaggio appeared twice on the American sitcom Young & Hungry as himself, in the 2014 pilot episode and in the episode "Young & Amnesia".</p><p>Voltaggio left The Dining Room in 2010 and announced plans to open his own restaurant in West Hollywood, California, in a space owned by former Hollywood superagent <a href=#>Michael Ovitz</a>. After several delays, the highly successful ink. opened on September 21, 2011. Voltaggio's goal with the restaurant was to create what he called "modern Los Angeles cuisine." The restaurant seats 60 in the dining room with a private room that can accommodate an additional 10 guests. It was named America's best new restaurant by GQ Magazine in March 2012.</p><p>While publicly developing and readying ink. for its highly anticipated debut, Voltaggio was quietly planning a smaller restaurant around the corner, a sandwich shop called ink.sack.

Michael completed his Greenbrier apprenticeship under Certified Master Chef <a href=#>Peter Timmins</a> at the age of 21. He later held jobs at the Ritz Carlton Hotel Naples, Florida under chef <a href=#>Peter Timmins</a> and Charlie Palmer's Dry Creek Kitchen in Healdsburg. During his tenure as Chef de Cuisine at The Bazaar by Jose Andres, the restaurant was nominated for the James Beard Foundation Award for Best New Restaurant in 2008.</p><p>Michael Voltaggio (born September 29, 1978) is an American chef residing in Los Angeles, California. Voltaggio was the winner of the sixth season of Top Chef, Bravo's cooking competition reality show, where he competed with his brother, <a href=#>Bryan Voltaggio</a>. The two ended in the finale, alongside <a href=#>Kevin Gillespie</a>, with Michael winning the contest. Top Chef Head Judge <a href=#>Tom Colicchio</a> said of Voltaggio, “Out of all the cooks that have come through the show, Michael is the most talented—both from a sensibility and technical standpoint. He has the chops to pull off what he’s trying to do.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVforaktMCeo2aun6HBorPGoqY%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./nancy-kwan-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nancy Kwan Net Worth | Celebrity Net Worth">&larr;
