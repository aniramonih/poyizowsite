The series follows a group of young people who are transported to a parallel world where they have to play deadly games to survive. One of the most intriguing characters in the series is Shuntaro Chishiya, a former medical student who becomes a skilled player in the Borderlands. But what happened to him at the end of the series? Is he alive or dead? Here is what we know so far.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who is Chishiya?</h2><p>Chishiya is a sly and cunning character who uses his wits and manipulation to win the games. He has a distinctive mole under his left eye and long blond hair. He is portrayed by Nijiro Murakami in the Netflix adaptation. According to Alice in Borderland Wiki, he specializes in Diamond games, which require logic and intelligence. He is also a former member and executive of the Beach, a community of players who live in luxury and comfort.</p><p>Chishiya is not interested in the concept of life, and he does not have a will to live. He is just looking for someone who is “interesting” in the Borderlands. He also has a dark past, as he was a pediatric cardiovascular physician who had to deal with the corruption and injustice in the medical system. He was unable to save a young patient named Hayato, who needed a heart transplant, because the hospital prioritized the grandson of a wealthy donor. This made him disillusioned and cynical about life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What did he do in the series?</h2><p>Chishiya first appeared in the second episode of the series, where he participated in the Six of Diamonds game with Arisu, Usagi, and Karube. He helped them solve the puzzle and escape from the burning building. He then joined them in the Five of Spades game, where he betrayed them and sided with the witch, who turned out to be Kuina. He revealed that he was working with Kuina to collect the cards and find a way out of the Borderlands.</p><p>He later appeared in the Beach arc, where he was one of the executives of the Beach community. He was involved in the Ten of Hearts game, where he manipulated Niragi and Kuzuryu to kill each other. He also tried to kill Arisu, but was stopped by Usagi. He then escaped from the Beach with Kuina and some other players.</p><p>He reappeared in the Jack of Diamonds game, where he teamed up with Arisu and Usagi again. He helped them defeat the Dealer, who was a former colleague of his from the hospital. He also revealed his past and his motivation for playing the games. He said that he wanted to find someone who could make him feel alive, and he thought that Arisu was that person.</p><p>He then participated in the King of Diamonds game, where he faced off against the King, who was the mastermind behind the Borderlands. He managed to outsmart the King and win the game, but he also sacrificed himself in the process. He pushed Arisu out of the way of a bullet and took the shot instead. He then collapsed on the ground, bleeding profusely.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is he dead or alive?</h2><p>The series did not explicitly show whether Chishiya died or not. The last scene of the series showed Arisu holding Chishiya’s hand and calling his name, while Chishiya’s eyes were closed. It is possible that he was still alive, but barely. It is also possible that he died from his wound, and Arisu was just in denial.</p><p>There are some clues that suggest that Chishiya might still be alive. For one thing, he was wearing a bulletproof vest under his shirt, which could have reduced the impact of the bullet. For another thing, he still had his visa card, which could have been used to revive him. According to Forbes, the series has been renewed for a second season, which could explore the fate of Chishiya and the other characters.</p><p>However, there are also some clues that suggest that Chishiya might be dead. For one thing, the bullet hit him in the chest, which could have damaged his vital organs. For another thing, he seemed to have accepted his death, as he smiled and thanked Arisu for making him feel alive. He also said that he was happy to die in a Diamond game, which was his specialty.</p><p>Therefore, the answer to the question “is chishiya dead” is not clear. It depends on how the series will continue the story and whether it will reveal the truth about Chishiya’s condition. Until then, fans can only speculate and hope for the best. Chishiya is a complex and fascinating character who has left a lasting impression on the viewers. He is one of the reasons why Alice in Borderland is such a thrilling and captivating series.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfnsBur8eiqqGhqZZ6pbHAnWStoJVis6LAxGamn2WknbJuv8uyZKmkka6ys3nIp2SapJmYsm61zWaZqKqUmr%2Btrc2dZg%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./is-fleece-johnson-free-or-still-in-the-jail-criminal-records-and-armed-robbery-case-details-393682-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Fleece Johnson Free Or Still In The Jail?
