Seems very familiar with Bruce Halle. He is an American business owner who is known to be the Chairman and founder of Discount Tire. Having lived among seven siblings at the time of Great Depression, Bruce cut grass, dug graves and even delivered newspapers to financially support his family. Having started with only 6 tires in his stock, Bruce is now the richest man in the city of Phoenix, Arizona.</p><p class=western lang=en-us align=justify><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.celebfamily.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Bruce-Halle-Family.jpg alt="Bruce Halle Family" width=594 height=423 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p class=western lang=en-us align=justify>Born in 1930, Bruce is now more than 85 years of age, and is still active in his business and philanthropic activities.

His father was a fireman, and his mother was the cousin of Harriet Martha Jenkins, who helped her get a loan so that they could buy a house of their own. His parents were poor, and his mother had to work for many years to support the family too. He remembers his father as being a calm person even in adverse circumstances.</p><h2 class=western lang=en-us align=justify>Bruce Halle Brother: Bob Halle</h2><p class=western lang=en-us align=justify>Bruce Halle had six siblings, but the only one known is Bob Halle.
