Jamie Foxx’s baby mama, Connie, was born on March 29, 1976, and is currently 47 years old.</strong></p><p>Before Jamie Foxx came into her life, Connie was living a normal life with her normal job and wouldn’t have made it to the spotlight otherwise. However, Foxx, a renowned Hollywood actor and musician, turned things around for Connie. Dating him catapulted her to fame. The fact that they share a daughter further means she will be in the spotlight for a while. However, Connie is not one to relish the perks of being involved with a celebrity. She prefers to stay away from the spotlight, but we dug up some interesting facts about her.</p><h3><strong>Summary of Connie Kline’s Bio</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Full name:</strong> Connie Kline</li><li><strong>Gender: </strong>Female</li><li><strong>Date of birth: </strong>March 29, 1976</li><li><strong>Connie Kline’s Age:</strong> 47 years old</li><li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> White</li><li><strong>Nationality:</strong> American</li><li><strong>Zodiac Sign:</strong> Aries</li><li><strong>Sexual Orientation:</strong> Straight</li><li><strong>Connie Kline’s Ex-partner:</strong> Jamie Foxx</li><li><strong>Connie Kline’s Children:</strong> Corinne Foxx</li><li><strong>Famous for:</strong> being Jamie Foxx’s baby mama</li></ul><h2><strong>Who is Jamie Foxx’s Baby Mama, Connie Kline, and How Old is she?</strong></h2><p>Connie Kline is mostly known as the ex-girlfriend of Jamie Foxx and the mother of one of his children. Kline was born on March 29, 1976, and she is currently 47 years old.</p><p>She is an American national born in California, United States. While the identity of her parents has not been established, it is clear that Connie is from a Caucasian background.</p><p>There is hardly any information about Connie’s early life, including the kind of upbringing she had. Jamie Foxx has mostly kept his baby mamas hidden from the spotlight, causing more speculations about them. As such, there is also nothing to show about the schools she attended, but from her work history, it seems she reached the college level.</p><h2><strong>A Look at Connie Kline and Jamie Foxx’s Relationship History</strong></h2><p>Connie Kline and Jamie Foxx dated for a rather short period that spanned from January to June 1993. The fact that they have a child may lead to speculation that they were together for a long period of time, but this is not the case. However, there is no information to show when and how they met each other.</p><p>After years of keeping her out of the spotlight, details about Jamie Foxx’s baby mama became public knowledge, and it was revealed that they met in January 1993. However, by June of the same year, the relationship had already turned sour.</p><p>Though they went their separate ways sooner than expected, Connie Kline and Jamie Foxx’s relationship produced one child named Corinne Foxx, who was born on February 15, 1994.</p><h2><strong>Connie Kline Became Corinne Foxx’s Mother in 1994</strong></h2><p>Jamie Foxx’s daughter, Corinne Foxx, was born on February 15, 1994, in Los Angeles and is currently 29 years old. While it is not clear if Connie Kline went on to get married after breaking up with Jamie Foxx, she seems to have another child aside from Corinne Foxx.</p><p>In 2016, Connie was caught on camera with a daughter she had in another relationship. They were going shopping in Simi Valley, which is where she resides, but nothing else is known about this daughter of hers, not even her name or the identity of her father. It also remains a mystery if Connie has other children aside from Corinne and her other daughter.</p><p>Of Connie’s two daughters, Corinne is the most popular one. She is widely known as the daughter of Jamie Foxx, but she has made a name for herself in the entertainment industry. Corinne is an American model and actress best known for her roles in Sweet/Vicious and 47 Meters Down: Uncaged.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzznigeria.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/03/POPCCMNEN5EFBI34LVLVC57MGY-e1679828923791.jpg><p>Corinne attended Sierra Canyon School as a high school student, and there, she was active as a cheerleader. She was featured on the cover of American Cheerleader in 2011 and after high school, she enrolled in the University of Southern California, where she studied Public Relations and joined the Pi Beta Phi sorority. Corinne continued her activities as a cheerleader in college, and after bagging her first degree, she attended Howard Fine Acting Studio and the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.</p><p>Born with performing arts genes, Corinne began acting from an early age. She first made a cameo appearance on The Jamie Foxx Show at the age of six. Growing up was fun for Corinne, who often went to red-carpet events with her father as his date. This exposed her to the entertainment industry, where she is now fully involved. She was Miss Golden Globe in 2016 and has made several appearances in both movies and TV shows.</p><p>Corinne has played two movie roles in 47 Meters Down: Uncaged Sasha (2019) and Safety (2020). Her small screen roles are about eight, with the latest being Ruby in Dollface which she played in 2022.</p><p>In addition to acting, Corinne is also building a modeling career which she debuted at the Bal des débutantes in November 2014. She has worked with brands like Ralph Lauren, Dolce & Gabbana, Kenneth Cole, and Wet ‘n’ Wild cosmetics. Corinne debuted in the New York Fashion Week in 2016 for Kanye West’s Yeezy line.</p><h2><strong>What Does Jamie Foxx’s Baby Mama Do for a Living?</strong></h2><p>Connie Kline is not just a baby mama to a celebrity, but she has her own career path. She first worked in the United States Air Force for about five years before she changed careers. She was a high school teacher in North Carolina and Manhattan for a while, but the name of the school where she taught is not mentioned.</p><p>In 1992, Connie became a tax agent with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). She is still in the tax profession but now works as a tax preparer for CK Financial in Simi Valley, California. Aside from her tax profession, Connie often dabbles in charity work. She has served with the Knights of Columbus organization on some charity projects.</p><h2><strong>Connie Kline’s Net Worth</strong></h2><p>Connie is yet to share her financial status, and her net worth is not public knowledge. Despite that, she is enjoying a life of luxury, thanks to her career earnings and her link to a Hollywood celebrity.</p><p>While Connie’s net worth is not known, Jamie Fox is known to have a net worth of about $170 million. Besides, Jamie Foxx has been very supportive of his baby mama even after their daughter is all grown. He reportedly gifted her a Mercedes Benz alongside a 5,000-square-foot estate located in California, and this is where she resides.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHr7XGnqmimV6YvK571KxmsKCfYra0ecKopaehlWK4rbXNnmScp6Keu6%2BxjJ%2BmsbCjYrqwwMeeqWaZnpl6q63Mopxmnp%2BtxbR5wZqZsmWdlrqiew%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./cris-galera-sologamy-divorce-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Cris Galera?
