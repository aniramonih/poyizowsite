More than 300 of the best tennis players in the world will be vying for the chance to take home some part of $44 million in prize money. For the vast majority of tennis players, succeeding at this year's tournament could be the difference between making money this year, or losing it. The pandemic has hit the sport particularly hard since tennis is a sport that requires a fair bit of international travel. Also consider the fact that tennis players are basically independent contractors – unlike football or basketball players, they don't have a team to fall back on. Fortunately, a Player Relief Fund has been set up to get more than $6 million out to 800 professional tennis players who don't make <a href=#>Roger Federer</a> or <a href=#>Naomi Osaka</a> style money.</p><p>Tennis pros at the top of their game on and off the court don't have much cause to worry about a less profitable 2020. Roger Federer, for instance, isn't competing in this year's U.S. Open. He's recovering from two knee surgeries. He is the highest-paid tennis player of the year for the 15th consecutive year. He's also the highest-earning athlete in the world. Almost all of Federer's income over the past year, 95% of it to be exact, was earned off the court. The 39-year-old Swiss champ ended his long term deal with Nike and signed a lucrative 10 year deal with Uniqlo, which promised to pay him $300 million whether or not he was playing tennis.</p><p>Federer made more than double the second-highest earner on this list. The top 10 players made a combined $340 million, which is up from last year's $312 million. Tennis is an attractive sport for brands because the audience is typically wealthier than most other sports and is pretty evenly split between men and women. This year's list is made up of four women, two of whom are playing in this year's U.S. Open (Naomi Osaka and <a href=# title="Serena Williams Net Worth">Serena Williams</a>) and six men.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-306855 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/GettyImages-1202930997.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-306855 class=wp-caption-text>Photo by Mike Owen/Getty Images</p><p>#10. <a href=# title="Simona Halep Net Worth">Simona Halep</a> – $10.9 million</p><p>Over her career, Halep has won $36.5 million in prize money, good enough for fourth all-time on the list of female tennis players.
