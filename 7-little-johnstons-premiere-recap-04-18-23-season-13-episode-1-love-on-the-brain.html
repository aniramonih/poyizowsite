Alex met Allie and they are official, Anna says she thinks she met the one.</p><p>There has been a lot going on with the family, the kids are young adults and in relationships. Liz and Bryce are together for four years and looking to buy a house. Alex has his first girlfriend Allie, and Anna met a nice young man at the conference. It is pretty exciting for mom and dad, a new phase in the journey of parenting.</p><p>The family is learning how to line dance for Liz’s birthday. The family loves to dance, Emma is the best dancer. The teacher, Shuanta Porter, says she made it really easy for them but she hasn’t taught little people before. Amber says Trent is dancing like a leprechaun.</p><p>Amber left her job and is full time in the social work program. Trent is still busy selling cars and doing projects around the house.</p><p>The line dancing goes great, Emma and Jonah did the best, but they video taped it so they can practice at home.</p><p>Back at home, Alex met Allie at the LP conference and he says it has been the best couple months of his life dating her. He video calls her on the computer to check up and they both say they are excited to see each other. For Allie’s birthday, he is going to fly out to Ohio to be with her. They live on a farm, Allie has two sisters but she is the only little person in her family. Amber remembers that it wasn’t so long ago when Alex wanted nothing to do with girls. Anna is happy that he found someone, so is Jonah.</p><p>Liz is moving out, so she plans one last sleep over with Anna and Emma. Liz says they are looking for a house that is dog friendly. The girls are making watermelon sushi, a soda pie – they put them in the oven and wait to see what crazy stuff they made. Liz tells them that they are looking at a house and really want it to be a good fit for Miller, their dog. Bryce says he is also excited about getting house with Liz. Both recipes fail.</p><p>They were TikTok recipes and they are both a fail. Next, the girls do facials together. They talk, Emma is in junior year and says she is still single. Luca is a boy she met at a conference, she had a crush on him, but they decided to be just friends. Anna met Topher at the LP conference, he wanted her to go to Alabama to see him, but she felt it was off and a lot of confusion, she is not ready to talk about it. Liz says no matter how bad the food was, the memories were great.</p><p>Trent and Amber started the bathroom renovation in the spring and the project is taking them a long time, six months so far. Their renovation turned out exactly the way Amber wanted it to look. Trent adds a disco ball and tells her that is how they stay married.</p><p>Bryce and Liz are going to look at a house to see if they like it. They love the house but the price is way out of their budget.</p><p>Emma is studying US history, she is struggling and asks Alex for help. Alex says he is excited about going to Allie’s birthday but he can’t figure out what to buy her.</p><p>Amber and Trent drop by Amber’s apartment to help her with her dryer that is not working properly. Trent asks about Topher, Anna says he was supposed to come for a visit but he rescheduled to go on a trip to Hawaii. She tells them they are more like friends, she felt a vibe after she visits him and his family.</p><p>Trent says he could have been intimidated by her success, a lot of guys do that.Amber tells her that he needs to make the next trip if there is one. And, next time if she knows in her gut it won’t go anywhere, she should let it go. Anna says it was hard because they liked him and liked them. Trent says maybe they showed their emotions to much when it came to Topher. Anna is clearly upset about the relationship.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWxnZ2K5qsDTpZxmop%2Bdu7TAzqeqZqiimrqqsdGeZKudk5a9bnyTZmhxZWJoerSxwKymp2VhaHqmvMispp2dXWZ6rbvVnmSopl2ptaZ5wauYoqZf</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./730-angel-number-meaning.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="730 Angel Number Meaning - Pulptastic">&larr;
