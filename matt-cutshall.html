He is 38 years old in 2023. His zodiac sign is Aquarius, which is a fixed air sign known for qualities such as being good friends, original, emotional, and so on.</p><p>The ruling planets of this star sign are Uranus and Saturn, and if you are an Aquarius, Saturday is your lucky day. There are few details about his childhood or education, but I assume he attended and graduated from a local school in his hometown.</p><p>He never mentioned his parents on the internet, but he frequently referred to actor and director Brendon McNerney as his step-brother. Brendon is also a filmmaker, writer, and musician, and he has his own YouTube channel as well as other social media accounts.</p><p>However, according to the source, his father and mother divorced when he was only eight years old. Chris Cutshall is Matt Cutshall’s twin brother. He even posted several pictures of himself with him on his social media profiles, telling his followers that he is his twin sibling.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Matt-Cutshal-1.jpg><h2>Matt Cutshall Girlfriend & Dating</h2><p><strong>Who is Matt Cutshall dating? </strong>Matt Cutshall’s love life is an open book, with his girlfriend ‘Arielle Vandenberg’ appearing on his social media accounts from the start. She is an actress, model, and content creator from the United States. Arielle has appeared in a number of projects, including How I Met Your Mother, CSI: Miami, Meet the Browns, Greek, and others.</p><p>The couple began dating in 2017 and quickly became a serious relationship after falling in love with each other. Their private engagement ceremony took place in 2019. Matt is a private person who has never spoken about his ex-girlfriends, but I am sure he was in a couple of relationships before dating Vandenberg.</p><p>On the other hand, this stunning model was romantically linked to Will Arnett, a Canadian actor best known for his roles in Arrested Development, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, The Brothers Solomon, and other films. She even dated her ex-boyfriend Alex Turner, an English singer and guitarist best known as a member of Arctic Monkeys.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Matt Cutshall developed a strong interest in singing and the entertainment industry at a young age. There is no specific date, but he and his bandmates formed the band ‘It Boys’ when he was a teenager in the early 2000s. Matt was the band’s lead vocalist, with Tommy Coops (bassist), Judah Leary (guitarist/vocalist), Jeffrey Oster (lead guitarist), and Duck Leary (drummer/singer) joining him.</p><p>It Boys released two albums that did well in the charts during their career. This album contains 17 songs. Matt Cutshall made his musical debut in 2010, and his debut studio album ‘Guys Don’t Like Me’ was released the following year.</p><p>‘Introduction’ was the title of their second studio album. The majority of the songs featured popular internet personalities like Cassadee Pope, J. Trill, BC Bean, Jeffree Starr, and many more. After gaining some fame and success, this online celebrity decided to take his talent to the next level and began posting videos on the popular app Vine, which is no longer available in the market.</p><p>According to my research, Cutshall posted his first Vine video on April 13, 2013. He surpassed one million followers as a result of his talent and consistent uploads. Many well-known viners, including KC James, Manon Mathews, Sunny Mabrey, Barron Boedecker, and others, were also featured on his Vine official account.</p><p>In addition, while making the Vine video, he met his future girlfriend Arielle Vandenberg. So, before the company decided to shut down in 2017, this celebrity had over 1.8 million followers.</p><p>In the meantime, Matt Cutshall launched his Instagram and YouTube accounts. His first YouTube video was released in 2016, but those videos are no longer available on his channel.</p><p>His most recent YT video, titled ‘felt emo might delete,’ was posted on March 13, 2019, and has received over 729+ K views. The video with the most views on his channel was published on August 4, 2020, and has 2.3 million views.</p><h2>Facts</h2><ul><li>He began his career in the entertainment industry at the age of 17 after graduating from high school.</li><li>According to the source, Matt’s first job was hosting shows for Radio Disney in Portland, Oregon.</li><li>Guys Don’t Like Me, which has 563+ K views on YouTube, helped him gain a lot of popularity. Furthermore, the song was ranked fourth on Sirius Radio’s Hits One chart.</li><li>He decided to embark on a solo career in 2013 after the band members began to experience numerous issues as a result of the record label with which they were signed.</li><li>Matt Cutshall went on numerous musical tours with his band for nearly three years, which helped him amass a whopping net worth of $1.5 million US dollars as of 2023.</li></ul><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikmqykYrC2wNKhmKWkXw%3D%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./megan-gaither-death-news-gone-viral-is-she-dead-or-alive-696397-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Megan Gaither Death News Gone Viral: Is She Dead Or Alive?">&larr;
