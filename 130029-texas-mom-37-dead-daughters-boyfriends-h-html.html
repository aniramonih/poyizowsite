Her daughters, ten-year-old London and 16-year-old Alexa were also found with gunshot wounds to their upper bodies, all at the home of Charles Wheeler, Olsen’s boyfriend of about 18 months.</p><p class=dh>According to DailyMail.com, a gun was <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6615423/This-case-far-Texas-cops-unconvinced-Texas-mom-killed-herself.html>recovered</a> from the scene, but no other information about their injuries or where the weapon was has been released.</p><p class=dh>Based on the scene of the tragedy, the Bexar County Medical Examiner ruled that Olsen committed suicide and that the girls were murdered.</p><p><h3 class=ih>DIGGING DEEPER</h3></p><p class=dh>At the moment, the <a class="me a" href=#>investigation</a> into the deaths has been stalled, but Sheriff Javier Salazar of the Bexar County Sheriff's Department is awaiting additional information.</p><p class=dh>Salazar is waiting for cell phone data to either verify or discard Wheeler’s claim that he slept at a relative's home out of town the night before the tragic occurrence. It was Wheeler who called 911 after discovering the bodies that dark Thursday morning.</p><p class=dh>Salazar and his detectives believe there is more to the deaths and do not want to rule out the possibility that Olsen and her kids may have been killed by a murderer who is on “no one's radar.”</p><p><h3 class=ih>BEYOND THE SURFACE</h3></p><p class=dh>As the search for evidence continues, Salazar told DailyMail.com the case is far from over. Questioning the current suicide ruling, the sheriff added:</p><p class=dh>“The medical examiner believes it’s a suicide based on what they saw. They have a more limited evidence bank to pick from. I have forensics and the crime scene and witness interviews and phone records and everything. In some cases, when the ME rules suicide, there are other corroborating things. But in this instance, I don't have that. I don't have a suicide note, a depressed phone call, a witness, I don't have any of these things. Most cases are just so much more clear-cut than this one.”</p><p class=dh>“If I didn't think there was even a slight chance [that all three were murdered], we would have written this case off a long time ago,” Salazar assured.</p><p><h3 class=ih>WHERE THE BOYFRIEND STANDS</h3></p><p class=dh>Wheeler, who police found out fought with Olsen the night before the bodies were found, has been named “a person of interest” in the case. He has been cooperating with the police so far and has not been arrested or named a suspect in the deaths.</p><p class=dh>Before her death, Olsen and her daughters lived with Wheeler in his $1 million San Antonio residence, the same house in which they were found dead.</p><p><h3 class=ih>AN UNLIKELY SUICIDE</h3></p><p class=dh>Olsen’s friends and family members do not believe that she killed herself or her children. A friend who wished to remain anonymous <a class="me a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6607581/Shooting-deaths-Texas-mother-two-daughters-officially-ruled-murder-suicide.html>told</a> the outlet:</p><p class=dh>“Everyone close to Nichol knows that she put her children above all, loved them with all her heart, and there's no possible way Nichol would ever hurt her children. Nichol was a very caring woman, had so much love in her heart, and too much to live for to ever hurt anyone including herself.”</p><p class=dh>Another friend described her as “an <a class="me a" href=#>amazing mother</a> who guarded her children like a hawk.”</p><p class=dh>A family friend has launched a GoFundMe page to raise money for a monkey enclosure at the Austin Zoo in memory of ten-year-old London who loved animals.</p><p class=dh>Olsen was also a mother to Skylar, a 22-year-old son from a previous marriage.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAb63MqKSapZFjsLC5jmpqaWhibnq1sdeaqmaln6J6dIOMnZyanF2Zrrazx62cq6tdl7y6stGinKeco2K1b7TTpqM%3D</p><hr><ul class=pager><li class=previous><a href=./the-rookie-creator-responds-concerns-season-6-delay-nathan-fillion-new-role.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Rookie creator responds to concerns over season 6 delay amid Nathan Fillion's project away from ">&larr;
