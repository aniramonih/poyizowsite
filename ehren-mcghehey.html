Is Ehren McGhehey married?</p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>Ehren McGhehey, nickname – Danger Ehren, is an American former professional snowboarder, actor, and stuntman who is best known for starring in the Jackass films.</p><p>Danger Ehren is also known for losing a tooth during a stunt.</p><h2><strong>Biography</strong></h2><p>He was born on November 29, 1976, in McMinnville, Oregon, USA.</p><p>His parents, Kenneth and Linda McGhehey, were both morticians. McGhehey later recalled that, as a result of his parents’ mutual profession, he spent a lot of time in mortuaries growing up.</p><p>McGhehey is the youngest of three siblings. His two elder siblings are named Lesley and Stacey.</p><p>He graduated from McMinnville High School in 1995.</p><p>After high school, McGhehey&nbsp;became a professional snowboarder.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-72581 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/danger-ehren-net-worth.jpg.webp alt="danger ehren net worth" width=850 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/danger-ehren-net-worth.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-1 data-svg=1 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-72581 class=wp-caption-text>2006 – @Getty</p><h2><strong>Snowboarding Career</strong></h2><p>McGhehey briefly entered the world of professional snowboarding as a young man. However, he was noted even then for his recklessness and derring-do, and he had to abandon his dreams of becoming a top snowboarding competitor after he broke his neck.</p><p>Following this, he briefly worked in a skate shop in Portland, Oregon.</p><h2><strong>Jackass</strong></h2><p>McGhehey began to perform his own small-scale stunts while working at the skate shop in Portland.</p><p>While there, his friend Dave England – a fellow Jackass cast member – asked the director of the show, Jeff Tremaine, to consider McGhehey for a spot on the show.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-72767 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/how-much-is-danger-ehren-worth.jpg.webp alt="how much is danger ehren worth" width=811 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/how-much-is-danger-ehren-worth.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-2 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-72767 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>Tremaine was impressed by McGhehey, and agreed to give him a regular spot on the show.</p><p>Ehren quickly distinguished himself on the set of Jackass, and established a reputation for a willingness to put himself in harm’s way.</p><p>Something that became a theme with McGhehey was the frequency with which he lost his teeth, with several stunts resulting in teeth being knocked out or broken.</p><p>This recklessness and lack of concern for his own physical well-being led to his being given the nickname “Danger Ehren.”</p><p>Ehren was frequently the butt of practical jokes perpetrated by the other Jackass cast members.</p><p>One such practical joke happened during the infamous ‘Terror Taxi’ skit, where McGhehey posed as a terrorist during a ride with an unsuspecting taxi driver. At the conclusion of the skit, the rest of the Jackass team revealed that the fake beard McGhehey was wearing was, in fact, fashioned from their shaved pubic hair.</p><p>McGhehey did not exhibit any distress or discomfort at these pranks at the time; however, he later admitted that he felt that some of the pranks perpetrated on him were tantamount to bullying.</p><h2><strong>Injuries</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-72768 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ehren-mcghehey-full-name.jpg.webp alt="ehren mcghehey full name" width=780 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ehren-mcghehey-full-name.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-3 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-72768 class=wp-caption-text>@Getty</p><p>During his time as a cast member of Jackass, McGhehey racked up a considerable number of injuries.</p><p>These include having his back broken three times, nine knee surgeries, a damaged testicle, and injuries to his eyes as a result of a tarantula’s urticating hairs.</p><p>The most severe injury sustained by McGhehey, however, is undoubtedly the skull fractures sustained as a result of his infamous ‘Lamborghini Tree Pull’ stunt.</p><p>The stunt, conceived as a tribute to how often he lost teeth in the course of his stunts, involved Bam Marghera driving his Lamborghini away with a string attached to it and one of McGhehey’s teeth.</p><p>The resultant force was enough to seriously damage McGhehey’s face, shattering his skull from his mouth to his eye.</p><p>He said for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PageSix</a> about the injuries he has sustained from doing the stunts:</p><p><strong>”I’ve had many, many injuries from it – 25 surgeries including nine knee surgeries and three broken backs.”</strong></p><p><strong>Update</strong> – McGhehey posted on his Instagram account in October 2018 – ”having another knee surgery making it an awesome 11 knees and now 27 total surgeries.”</p><p>In 2006, he appeared in Jackass Number Two, while in 2010, in Jackass 3D (that also starred Chris Pontius, <a href=#>Brandon Novak</a>, Margera, Dunn, Johnny Knoxville, and Brandon Novak). Both films were later accompanied by Jackass 2.5 and 3.5.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-72580 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ehren-mcghehey-wife.jpg.webp alt="ehren mcghehey wife" width=800 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/ehren-mcghehey-wife.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-4 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-72580 class=wp-caption-text>Ehren McGhehey attends “Jackass 3D” Premiere at Mann’s Chinese Theater on October 13, 2010 in Hollywood – @Getty</p><p>He was an executive producer on the movie All Hell Breaks Loose (2014).</p><p>From 2012 to 2016, McGhehey portrayed an unnamed motorcycle guy in five episodes of the sketch comedy television Portlandia.</p><p>In 2017, he appeared in one episode of Ridiculousness, a comedy clip show that is hosted by Rob Dyrdek.</p><p>Jackass 4.5 was released in 2022, with McGhehey appearing in the film.</p><h2><strong>Wife/Girlfriend</strong></h2><p>There is no information on whether Ehren McGhehey has a wife or is dating anyone at the moment.</p><h2><strong>Height</strong></h2><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-72582 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/erin-mcgehee-jackass.jpg.webp alt="erin mcgehee jackass" width=950 height=1200 sizes="(max-width: 760px) calc(100vw - 24px), 720px" data-pin-media=https://famouspeopletoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/erin-mcgehee-jackass.jpg id=mv-trellis-img-5 data-trellis-processed=1 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-72582 class=wp-caption-text>“Danger Ehren” Ehren McGhehey attends the “Jackass 3” DVD launch party – @Getty</p><p>McGhehey is 6′ 1″ (1.85 m) tall.</p><p><strong>READ MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Brock O’Hurn Height</a></p><h2><strong>Quotes</strong></h2><p>”Sometimes you eat the bar, and sometimes the bar eats you!”</p><p>”Life is a reflection on the past and an idea for the future.”</p><p>”You only get one body.
